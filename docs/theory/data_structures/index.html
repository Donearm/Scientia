<main><h1>Data Structures</h1>
<h1 id="linked-list">Linked List</h1>
<p>Versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Singly Linked List
<ul>
<li>a singly linked list contains nodes which have a data field and a next
field, pointing to the next node in the list</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Doubly Linked List
<ul>
<li>a doubly linked list contains, besides the next field and the data field,
another link field that points to the <strong>previous</strong> node in the list. This
is called the <em>forward</em> or <em>backward</em> or <em>previous</em> field</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multiply Linked List
<ul>
<li>a multiply linked list is like a doubly linked list, only with multiple
number of fields pointing in different directions. Actually a doubly
linked list is just a special case of a multiply linked list</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Circular Linked List
<ul>
<li>in a circular linked list the last node, instead of being <em>null</em>, is a
pointer to the head of the list, making it circular. It is also called
<em>open</em> or <em>linear</em> list</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Unrolled Linked List
<ul>
<li>a variation of a linked list in which each node stores multiple elements,
in the form of arrays</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Association List
<ul>
<li>an early implementation of an associative array, common in Lisp and later
functional languages (Scheme, OCaml, Haskell). In Lisp is also called
<em>alist</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>XOR Linked List
<ul>
<li>an implementation of a doubly linked list that use <em>bitwise XOR</em>
operation to store more efficiently the <em>forward</em> and <em>backward</em> field.
It stores both in a single field by XORing the 2 fields&rsquo; addresses. To
parse the list then it&rsquo;s needed also the address of the 2 consecutive
elements other than the XORed field of the current one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>VList
<ul>
<li>a singly linked list of arrays whose sizes decreases geometrically, from
the first to the last. Usually the first array contains roughly half the
total number of elements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A <strong>Sentinel Node</strong> may also be implemented as the first or last node instead
of using <em>null</em> values, to speed up operations (removing the need for an
expensive branch operation to check for <em>null</em>). It does not hold any data.</p>
<h1 id="dynamic-array">Dynamic Array</h1>
<p>Also called <em>growable array</em>, <em>resizable array</em>, <em>dynamic table</em>, <em>mutable
array</em> or <em>array list</em> is a data structure that is made of 2 parts of a fixed
size array: the first stores the actual elements and the second is reserved.
This makes very fast to add elements to the array afterwards, up until the total
<em>capacity</em> of the array (<em>size</em> is called the size of the allocated elements).</p>
<p>Variants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gap Buffer
<ul>
<li>a dynamic array type that allows efficient insertion and deletion
operations near the same location</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Hashed Array Tree (HAT)
<ul>
<li>an hashed array tree has a top-level array where each element contains a
power of two number of leaf arrays. All leaf arrays are the same size of
the top level array (the <em>directory</em>). It&rsquo;s similar to a hash table. It
can hold at most m² elements, where <code>m</code> is the size of the <em>directory</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sparse Array
<ul>
<li>an array in which most of the elements have the same value (the <em>default
value</em>, usually 0 for array of numbers and <code>null</code> for array of objects)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Multimap
<ul>
<li>a generalization of a map or array in which more than 1 value may be
associated and returned for a single key. Implementations are: <code>container</code>
(C++), <code>MultiMap</code> (Java)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Suffix Array
<ul>
<li>a sorted array of all suffixes of a string. Also known as <em>PAT array</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>FM-index
<ul>
<li>a suffix array that undergoes the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrows-Wheeler_transform">Burrows-Wheeler
transform</a> of the
input text. It is used to efficiently find the occurrences of a pattern
within the text</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Judy Array
<ul>
<li>a high performance, low memory usage implementation of an associative
array. Judy arrays may be sparse, containing large ranges of unassigned
indices. Similar to a highly optimised 256-ary trie</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>std::vector</code> (C++), <code>ArrayList</code> (Java and .Net), <code>List&lt;&gt;</code> (.Net 2.0),
<code>OrderedCollection</code> (SmallTalk), <code>list</code> (Python)*</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="skip-list">Skip List</h1>
<p><img src="http://igoro.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/multilist.png" alt="" title="Skip 
List example"></p>
<p>Basically, a skip list is a normal linked list that has multiple levels,
themselves linked lists. The bottom level is a linked list linking all elements,
one after another; then the subsequent levels may link only the odd elements,
jumping one or two at the time and so on up until the topmost level that usually
links only the head to the middle and then the tail. They <em>skip</em> elements, thus
the name.</p>
<h1 id="binary-tree">Binary Tree</h1>
<p>A binary tree is a data structure in which each node has at most 2 child nodes.
Nodes with children are called <em>parent nodes</em> and there may exists a <em>root</em>
node, the origin of all nodes. Definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>depth</strong> of a node is the length of the path from the root to the node.
Sometimes called <em>level</em></li>
<li><strong>depth</strong> of a tree is the length of the path from the root to the deepest
node. Sometimes called <em>height</em></li>
<li><strong>siblings</strong> are nodes that share the same parent node</li>
<li><strong>ancestor</strong> is a node <code>n</code> of node <code>q</code> if it exists on the path from root to
node <code>q</code>. It is then a <strong>descendant</strong> of <code>n</code></li>
<li><strong>size</strong> of a node is the number of descendants it has, itself included</li>
<li><strong>in-degree</strong> of a node is the number of nodes arriving at that node</li>
<li><strong>out-degree</strong> of a node is the number of nodes leaving that node</li>
</ul>
<p>Variants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rooted Binary Tree
<ul>
<li>a tree with a root node in which each leaf node has at most 2 children</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Full Binary Tree
<ul>
<li>a tree in which every node, not only the leaves, has 2 children. More
precisaly, every node has either 0 or 2 children. Also called <em>proper
binary tree</em>, <em>2-tree</em> or <em>strictly binary tree</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Perfect Binary Tree
<ul>
<li>a tree in which all leaves are at the same depth or same level and in
which every parent has exactly 2 children</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Complete Binary Tree
<ul>
<li>a tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely
filled and all nodes are as far left as possible</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Balanced Binary Tree
<ul>
<li>a tree in which the depth of the 2 subtrees of every node differ by 1 or
less; more generally, it is a binary tree where no leaf is much farther
away from the root than any other leaf.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Degenerate Tree
<ul>
<li>a tree where each parent node has only 1 child node. Basically not,
performance-wise, a linked list</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dancing Tree
<ul>
<li>a self-balancing tree that balances its nodes only when flushing data to
the disk, to gain performance by delaying optimization. Used in the
Reiser4 filesystem</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>B-tree
<ul>
<li>a tree that&rsquo;s not limited to 2 child nodes. Vastly used in databases and
filesystems</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>B+-tree
<ul>
<li>a b-tree that stores copies of the keys in the internal nodes. Keys and
records are normally stored in leaves. A leaf node may include a pointer
to the next leaf node</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>B*-tree
<ul>
<li>the b*-tree balances more neighboring internal nodes to keep them more
densely packed. It requires non-root nodes to be at least 2/3 full instead
than 1/2. To achieve this, instead of splitting up a node when it gets
full, its keys are shared with a node next to it. Only when both nodes are
full they get split up in a third node</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>B+tree
<ul>
<li>as a b-tree but with usually large number of nodes and in which all nodes
contain only keys (not pairs) and to which an additional level is added at
the bottom with linked leaves</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Red-Black Tree
<ul>
<li>a version of a balanced binary tree where each node is &ldquo;painted&rdquo; in two
distinct colours, tipically red and black, in such a way that the
resulting tree won&rsquo;t be significantly unbalanced. Tracking the colour of
every node it&rsquo;s fast because it only requires 1 bit (just 2 colours). The
root node is usually considered black, all leaves and the children of the
same node are black too, the rest is red</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AA Tree
<ul>
<li>named after its inventor, Arne Andersson, is a variant of a red-black tree
that allows the red nodes to be added only in the right direction. No red
node can thus be a left sub-child</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AVL Tree
<ul>
<li>the first implementation of a balancing binary tree, named after its
inventors (G.M.Adelson-Velskii and E.M.Landis)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Splay Tree
<ul>
<li>a self balancing tree that adds an operation, <em>splaying</em>, that rearranges
the tree itself by putting a specific element as the root, making very
quick to access it again</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2-3 Tree
<ul>
<li>a tree where every node with children has either 2 children and 1 data
element or 3 children and 2 data elements. Nodes on the outside of of the
tree, <em>leaf nodes</em>, have no children and 1 or 2 data elements. It&rsquo;s
similar to the AA tree</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2-3-4 Tree
<ul>
<li>a tree commonly used to implement dictionaries. Numbers mean a tree where
every node with 2 children has either 2 children and 1 data element or 3
children and 2 data elements or 4 children and 3 data elements. Also
called <em>2-4 tree</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cartesian Tree
<ul>
<li>a binary tree derived from a sequence of numbers. Each number has a node
in the tree, with left nodes coming before the root in the sequence while
the right subtree consists of later numbers. The tree has the <em>heap
property</em>, the parent of any non-root node has a smaller value than the
node itself</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rope
<ul>
<li>a binary tree used to store strings. Leaves contain a short string; each
node has weight equal to the length of the string plus the sum of all the
weight in its left subtree. Thus a node with 2 children divides the whole
string in 2 parts: the left part stores the first part of the string, the
right part stores the second part and its weight is the sum of the left
child&rsquo;s weight and the length of its contained string. Also called <em>cord</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Threaded Binary Tree
<ul>
<li>a binary tree that has all the right child pointers that would be normally
be null point to the successor of the node and all the left child
pointers, that would too be normally null, point to the predecessor of the
node</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ternary Tree
<ul>
<li>a tree in which each node has at most 3 child nodes, usually called
<em>left</em>, <em>mid</em> and <em>right</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bsp-tree">BSP Tree</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/90e4/c4a65b4b04d9e2374e5753659c102de4c0eb.pdf">Paper on BSP (Binary Spacing Partitioning)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="binary-indexed-tree">Binary Indexed Tree</h2>
<p>A complete and clear answer on <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/10538/bit-what-is-the-intuition-behind-a-binary-indexed-tree-and-how-was-it-thought-a">SO</a> about the intuition behind a Binary Indexed Tree.</p>
<h1 id="heap">Heap</h1>
<p>a tree that satisfies the <em>heap property</em>: if <code>A</code> is a parent node of <code>B</code>, then
<code>key(A)</code> is ordered with respect to <code>key(B)</code>. The same applies across the heap.
Thus, either the keys of parent nodes are always greater than or equal to those
of the children and the highest key is the root (this kind of heap is called
<em>max heap</em>) or the keys of the parent node are less or equal to those of the
children (<em>min heap</em>)</p>
<p>Variants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beap
<ul>
<li>a data structure where every node has 2 parents and 2 children, unless it
is the first or on the last level. Also known as <em>bi-parental heap</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Binary Heap
<ul>
<li>very similar to a binary tree but with two additional constraints: it is a
complete binary tree, thus all levels are fully filled except maybe the
last, and each node is greater or equal to each of its children, making
thus a heap and not just a tree</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fibonacci Heap
<ul>
<li>a heap consisting of a collection of trees, even separated, satisfying the
<em>minimum-heap property</em> (every child is always greater or equal to the
parent)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Leftist Heap
<ul>
<li>a variant of a binary heap. Every node has an <em>s-value</em> which is the
distance to the nearest leaf. Unlike binary heaps, a leftist heap (also
called <em>leftist tree</em>) is very unbalanced and mantained so the right
descendant of each node has the lower s-value</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2-3 Heap
<ul>
<li>a heap similar to the 2-3 tree</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>d-ary Heap
<ul>
<li>a generalization of a binary heap in which the nodes have <code>d</code> children
instead of 2. Thus a binary heap is a <em>2-heap</em>. Also simply called a
<em>d-heap</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Skew Heap
<ul>
<li>a heap similar to a binary heap but without structural constraints. Only
two conditions must be satisfied: the general heap order must be enforced
and every operation on two skew heaps must be done using a special <em>skew
heap merge</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>make_heap</code>, <code>push_heap</code> and <code>pop_heap</code> (C++), <code>java.util.PriorityQueue&lt;E&gt;</code>
(Java), <code>heapq</code> (Python), <code>SplMaxHeap</code> and <code>SplMinHeap</code> (Php), <code>Heap</code> (Perl),
<code>heap</code> (Go)*</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="associative-array">Associative Array</h1>
<p>Also called <em>map</em> or <em>dictionary</em> is a collection of pairs (key, value) such
that each keys appear at most once in the collection</p>
<p>Variants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hash Table
<ul>
<li>an associative array that uses a <em>hash function</em> to compute an <em>index</em> into
an array of <em>buckets</em> or <em>slots</em> from which the correct value can be
found. Hash collisions, different keys that are assigned by the function
to the same bucket, can happen</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dictionary</code> (Smalltalk, Objective-C, .Net, Python), <code>hash</code> (Perl, Ruby),
<code>map</code> (C++, Java, Go, Clojure, Scala), <code>hash table</code> (Common Lisp, PowerShell),
<code>table</code> (Lua)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="bit-array">Bit Array</h1>
<p>An array that stores bits, as in 0 or 1 values. Known also as <em>bitmap</em>,
<em>bitset</em>, <em>bit string</em>, <em>bit field</em> or <em>bit vector</em></p>
<p>Implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bitfield</code> (C), <code>BitSet</code> (Java), <code>bitset</code> (C++), <code>BitArray</code> (.Net)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="trie">Trie</h1>
<p>Also called <em>digital tree</em> or <em>prefix tree</em>, the trie is used to store an
associative array where keys are usually strings. Differently from a binary
search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; its
position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated. All the
descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that
node, and the root is associated with an empty string. Values are associated
with leaves, not every node.</p>
<p>Variations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Radix Tree
<ul>
<li>a space-optimized trie where each node with only one child is merged with
its child, resulting in every internal node having 2 children. Also called
<em>patricia trie</em>, _radix trie or <em>compact prefix tree</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Suffix Tree
<ul>
<li>a tree that presents the suffixes of a given string in a way that allows
fast operations on it. Its edges are labeled with strings, such that each
suffix of the string corresponds to exactly one path from the tree&rsquo;s root
to the leaf. The suffix tree is like a radix tree for the suffixes of a
string</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>B-Trie
<ul>
<li>a trie that can store and retrieve variable-length strings efficiently on
disk</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="record">Record</h1>
<p>A value that contains other values, generally in fixed number, order and indexed
by names. Record elements are called <em>fields</em> or <em>members</em>. Unlike arrays,
records have fixed number of fields, all with a name, and with different types
among them. Also called <em>tuple</em>, <em>struct</em> or <em>compound data</em></p>
<h1 id="union">Union</h1>
<p>Very similar to records, an union may have multiple elements but only one at the
time can have a value as unions&rsquo; elements are stored at a single spot in memory
and thus setting any value will overwrite all other elements&rsquo; values. As an
advantage, they are clearly more compact than records.</p>
<p>Variants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tagged Union
<ul>
<li>an union that has a tag field that signals which type is in use and which
field is active. Also known as <em>variant</em>, <em>variant record</em>,
<em>discriminated union</em>, <em>disjoint union</em> or <em>sum type</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="set">Set</h1>
<p>A structure that can store any arbitrary value, in no particular order, and no
repeated value. It can be <em>static</em> or <em>frozen</em>, not modifiable after the
creation, or <em>dynamic</em> or <em>mutable</em>, that are modifiables.</p>
<p>Implementations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Set</code> (Java), <code>NSSet</code> and similar classes (Objective-C), <code>set</code> and <code>frozenset</code>
(Python), <code>HashSet</code> and <code>SortedSet</code> (.Net), <code>set</code> (Ruby), <code>Data.Set</code> (Haskell)</li>
</ul>
<p>Variations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiset
<ul>
<li>a generalization of a set, allowing repeated/duplicates values in either
identical or different objects storing the same value. Also known as
<em>bag</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
