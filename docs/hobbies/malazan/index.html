<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<p>As a great fan of the Malazan Book of the Fallen fantasy series, I like to collect small notes and facts during my rereads. Here they are, as a curiosity or starting point of further researching.</p>
<p>The notes are separated by the book they are in, and ordered by page count.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="memories-of-ice">Memories of Ice</h3>

<li><code>pg 748</code>: Anomander Rake explains how when Heboric was punished, Fener denied him and his hands. Then when Heboric touched the jade statue on the Otataral island, which contained the souls of the followers of the Crippled God, its chaotic magic fought Fener&rsquo;s. It eventually pushed the God out of his realm, into the mortal one</li>
<li><code>pg 799</code>: Kellanved ordered the Logros clan to look for all other T&rsquo;lan Imass clans. The quest was unsuccessful</li>

<li><code>pg 972</code>: Draconus created Dragnipur to preserve the Throne of Darkness from the assailing powers of Chaos. The more, and more powerful, souls that are sent into it, the faster the internal carriage moves away from Chaos.

</ul>
<h3 id="house-of-chains">House of Chains</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>pg 295</code>: The ship of the Emperor apparently sunk in Malaz City harbour the night of the &ldquo;assassination&rdquo;</li>
<li><code>pg 296-297</code>: Admiral Nok recounts how the Empire started:
<ul>
<li>Kellanved and Dancer were the first partners. They teamed up to bring down Mock, a pirate ruler of Malaz island</li>
<li>Nok Ameron and Hawl, Nok&rsquo;s wife, joined them.</li>
<li>They all had access to the Deadhouse on the island, using it as a base and benefitting from its powers. They were granted longevity, immunity to most diseases and &ldquo;other things&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Next to be recruited were the Napan brothers Cartheron and Urko Crust, Surly, Dassem Ultor.</li>
<li>Toc the Elder, Tayschreen, at the time a renegade high septarch of the D&rsquo;rek cult, and Dujek were the last to be recruited into the &ldquo;family&rdquo;, as Nok calls it.</li>
<li>Surly was of the Napan royal line.</li>
<li>When Surly became Laseen and &ldquo;killed&rdquo; Kellanved and Dancer, the first to disappear and abandon her were the Napan of the family, the Crust brothers and Ameron (an half-Napan to be correct).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>pg 480-481</code>: Kimloc the Spiritwalker associated a Tanno song with the Bridgeburners. The song needs to eventually be sanctioned, and for that are both necessary a Bridgeburner and the place where they were born, thus Raraku.</li>
<li><code>pg 481-482</code>: The giants of jade have created otatarale when they fell from another realm, due to the powerful magic necessary to pull them (or rather the Crippled God). So far 3 giants have been discovered.</li>
<li><code>pg 587-592</code>: in a drugged dream Heboric has a vision of the jade giants. He sees how they follow the Crippled God through a large flaming sash in the sky, and how they contain thousands of its followers.</li>
<li><code>pg 674</code>: Onrack painted Kilava in a cave, somehow trapping her and rendering her thus immortal, before the Tellan ritual. He was for this condemned to die but escaped punishment thanks to the menace of four Jaghut Tyrants allying
together. Kilava in turn would tun on her clan, killing them all but for Onon T&rsquo;oolan, her brother, that resisted her.</li>
<li><code>pg 778-779</code>: Logros T&rsquo;lan Imass moved the First Throne away from the Nameless Ones because they feared that if one of them were to sit on it, he would order all T&rsquo;lan Imass to permanently move inside the Azath Houses and
in all practice disappear from the world.</li>
<li><code>pg 779</code>: Kellanved sought for and in the end discovered the First Throne. He claimed it but commanded the T&rsquo;lan Imass only sparingly.</li>
<li><code>pg 817-818</code>: Osric tells his son L&rsquo;oric how the Deragoth domesticated some of the Eres, the Imass and humans progenitors. They fought against the K&rsquo;Chain Che&rsquo;Malle, destroying their skykeeps. Later, after the Eres extinction, the Deragoth allied with the First Empire of Dessimbelackis.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="midnight-tides">Midnight Tides</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>pg 25-26</code>: Mael asked Gothos to preserve the field of battle between the Tiste, Andii and Edur, and the K&rsquo;Chain Che&rsquo;Malle. It caused the Gothos Ice Fields in north Lether and presumably blocked the development of magic on the continent to our days.</li>
<li><code>pg 206</code>: in a vision Udinaas sees a Forkrul Assail inside the Letheras Azath House, next to the corpses of a murdered Jaghut family.</li>
<li><code>pg 278-279</code>: Udinaas has another vision in which a dialogue between Ossric and Menandore, Sukul Ankhadu, and Sheltatha Lore reveals a couple of facts:
<ul>
<li>Ossric mated with Mother Dark and was the father of the three above-mentioned sisters</li>
<li>Sheltatha Lore had two daughters with Draconus, Spite and Envy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>pg 538-539</code>: Silchas Ruin tells Kettle a few facts about the Forkrul Assail:
<ul>
<li>They usually lived separated from the other races, but occasionally allied with them, namely with the Jaghut</li>
<li>The draconic kins of Silchas Ruin took care to exterminate most of the FA</li>
<li>Not many free FA remains. Most are imprisoned, but those who are free are worshipped by mortals</li>
<li>Kettle has a FA soul</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>pg 541</code>: Silchas Ruin talks with Kettle of her second soul, beside the first that was of a Forkrul Assail. This one is from an Eres, and the Nerek of the Letheri continent worshipped her/him with the name &ldquo;Nameless One&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-bonehunters">The Bonehunters</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>pg 90-95</code>: Cotillion speaks with 3 pure Eleint dragons, chained by Anomander Rake in Kurald Emurlahn, gathering a few news and facts:
<ul>
<li>The dragons wanted the Shadow Throne</li>
<li>Anomander Rake invaded Kurald Emurlahn in answer to Scabandari&rsquo;s betrayal, and chained the dragons</li>
<li>The dragons claim that Shadowthrone is not sitting on the true Throne of Shadow</li>
<li>The Elder Gods are not of one world, and were present as elemental forces before Darkness and Light</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>pg 95</code>: Edgewalker tells Cotillion that he can consider him an elemental force</li>
<li><code>pg 146</code>: Mebra believes Heboric to possess the power to destroy the world</li>
<li><code>pg 194</code>: The Soldier of House Death appears to Cutter and Heboric while
hunting Skinner. He is surprised that Darujisthan is not ruled by a Tyrant
with a Seguleh army. The Soldier himself was a Seguleh in life, and one that
speaks freely and much more than his modern compatriots.</li>
<li><code>pg 280-282</code>: Mappo and Icarium reflect on the murdering of Sorrit, an Elder
Dragon. They come to the conclusion that a Jaghut or the Tiste Edur committed
the murder.</li>
<li><code>pg 475</code>: Ganath, a Jaghut, tells Paran of how the Errant&rsquo;s became the enemy
of stagnation, ennui. He became an ever changing divinity, and in this
transformation attracted the ire of the Forkrul Assail, as it opposed their
world view. They tried to murder the Errant and all his followers, mostly
Imass, Barghast, and Trell worshippers.</li>
<li><code>pg 561</code>: Dessimbelackis made a pact with the last 7 Deragoth while trying to
become a God. Far more Deragoth existed in ancient times, when they
domesticated the Eres&rsquo;al.</li>
<li><code>pg 597-598</code>: Taralack Veed reveals a few facts about Icarium&rsquo;s past while
traveling with him. He was driven by the need to free his father trapped
inside an Azath house. In attempting so, he shattered a wounded warren,
destroyed an Azath, and released an host of demonic creatures. Ultimately
Icarium failed to free his father, and attracted instead the attention of the
Nameless Ones, Azath worshippers. They bound Icarium, who had lost all memory
of his past after his bout of rage against the Azath, to a series of
companions that were put beside him to guide and prevent the half-Jaghut to
unleash his rage ever again. These companions were gifted with longer
life-span than their similars.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-return-of-the-crimson-guard">The Return of the Crimson Guard</h3>
<ul>
<li><code>pg 239</code>: Stoop tells other Crimson Guard recruits how years ago in Stratem
the Malazan Empire sent 40000 troops to exterminate them. The Guard was
vastly outnumbered but managed to survive the assault of the Malazans.
Skinned fought Dassem Ultor &ldquo;to a standstill&rdquo; and the Duke Davore
disappeared. It was chosen to start the Diaspora to avoid the Malazans to
ever corner the Crimson Guard all together in a single place, risking
extermination.</li>
