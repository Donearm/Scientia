      <description>Cigars flavours Plants Spices and Herbs Earth and Minerals Fruits Nuts Flowers Other Not-Really-Flavor Flavors Brands I am not an heavy smoker by any statistics. I dislike cigarettes and vaping, never got into weed even. But cigars, I like them. Very rarely I smoke one, more often the small ones, cigarillos, rather than the chunky ones. One every 2-3 weeks, at most.
I am not a huge fan nor a conneisseur.</description>

      <description>Chronology of fantasy of importance Warhammer 40k Reading list I have always been an avid fantasy reader. I started as a young kid in the late 1980s and ended up reading most of what I believe are the most important works within the genre. As a strong believers that you need to know the past to appreciate the right things in the present, I have developed a canon of the important works of fantasy that everybody should read to be well-versed in it.</description>

      <description>Occasionally, I also play games. Not as much as in my youth, and rarely more than one game at time. But I do like games, even if I don&amp;rsquo;t consider myself a gamer in the modern sense (and surely neither a pro&amp;hellip;).
Here I collect a few links and tips about games I enjoy(ed).

      <description>Noticeable lyrics I rarely pay attention to lyrics. I am more focused on the music, the vibe, the technical skills of the instrumentalists rather than the words (and the singing as well). Occasionally a song catches my attention in an unusual way and then I go to read the lyrics.
More often than not, the lyrics aren&amp;rsquo;t that great but very, very rarely, they are. I will save here links to lyrics that are worth reading (and the song isn&amp;rsquo;t bad either).</description>
