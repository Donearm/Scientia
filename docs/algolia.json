In the philosophy of mind realm, Eliminativism means the denial of existence of various states of the mind, such as belief or desire. It postulates how no scientifical basis for the existence of these states will ever be found.\nOther versions include also pain or visual perceptions in this denial.\nThis current of thought originates in the 1960-1970s.\nEliminativism is in direct contrast with common physicology, asserting how it has roughly failed and most of it will be corrected/negated by neuroscience and developments of artificial intelligence. Original eliminativists considered both true that some mental states didn\u0026amp;rsquo;t exist and that they could be explained in terms of lower-level neurophysiological states. Modern ones tend to think more on the complete denial of many mental states, rather that using neuroscience as an explanation.\nNotable philosphers of Eliminativism  Wilfred Sellars W.V. Quine Paul Feyerabend Richard Rorty B.F. Skinner Paul and Patricia Churchland Daniel Dennett  References  Main Wikipedia\u0026amp;rsquo;s page about Eliminativism  Moral Nihilism The view that asserts that there is nothing morally right or wrong. It opposes traditional views in which moral proprieties or methods hold objectively and from which we can decide the morality of our actions. For the moral nihilists such proprieties do not exist in the world, therefore the traditional meaning of morality does not exists as well.\nMoral assertions can be true or false only if there are moral proprieties. Once those are rejected, it is logical that the former cannot exist.\nNotable philosophers of Moral Nihilism  J. L.
