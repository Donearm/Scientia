Mostly like $? in Bash __file__ = Contains the name of the file loaded (a module if importing or the filename of the script) locals() = Returns a dictionary with the local namespace globals() = Returns a dictionary with the global module namespace. Inside a class or function returns the module where this is declared, not where it’s being executed enumerate() = Returns a list’s elements with numeric indexes. For example, 0, abc, 1, def etc. [::2] = Slice of a list, iterating every 2 elements. Works also by selecting a range ([1:10:2]) [::-1] = Iterate over a list backward print(\"The {foo} is a {bar}\".format(foo='answer', bar='42')) = String substitution in print using an alphanumerical index first,*rest,last = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7) = Assign first element of the tuple to first, the last to last, and all those in between to rest. Python 3 only first,second,*rest = 1,2,3,4,5,6 = Similarly to above, assign 1 to first, 2 to second and from 3 onward to rest. Rest will result in a list ([3,4,5,6]). Python 3 only __qualname__ = Attribute of classes and functions showing the “path” from the module top-level to their definition. Practically shows all the parents functions/classes of a function/class.

For huge lists it should be quicker than using .sorted() Calendar class HTMLCalendar = Format to html a calendar. After instantiating, use it like i.formatmonth(2012,11) to obtain the html code for november 2012 python -m calendar 2013 = Outputs the calendar for the 2013. It can be customized to print in html or text format, with or without a css and by width, lines, spacing etc. (see python -m calendar -h) Cgitb cgitb.enable() = Enable a very verbose traceback. With argument format=\"html\" the output is html Collections class Counter = A class to count the occurrences of a character or integer inside a list, dictionary or string. Returns a dictionary like {'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'c': 2} collections.deque = A different kind of queue, where values can be pushed or popped from both sides and not only one like in normal queues collections.OrderedDict = A dictionary that remembers the order in which values have been inserted and when iterated upon, returns value in that exact order.

Includes a spurious copy created by getrefcount itself. Object can be a variable, a class or a function sys.getsizeof(object) = Returns how much memory is occupying object. For classes, doesn’t include also all the attributes sys.modules = Contains the currently loaded modules (recursively) Time time.clock() = Returns the cpu time, the number of clocks from the execution of the current program.

    "content": " Various useful commands Cherry picking a range of commits Github Various useful commands A brief Git cheatsheet. Only the commands I found more useful (or that I repeatedly forget the syntax :) )\ngit mv oldfile newfile = Move a file, or simply rename it git reset --hard SHA1_HASH = Revert to the commit with SHA1_HASH and delete all subsequent commits git revert SHA1_HASH = Like above but write a new commit that restore the repository as it was on SHA1_HASH commit. All the subsequent commits, that with --hard would have been lost, are still in the log and can be quickly reverted back to git log \u003e Changelog = Save the log as a simple changelog git log file = Show all commits that modified file. Usually file is a full path but it is also possible to use wildcards, like **/*.js git log -Sstring -p = Show all commits that match string and show also their changes (-p) git log -p --grep \"perl_regexp\" = Show all commits whose message matches perl_regexp git merge somebranch = Merge somebranch with current branch git checkout -b somebranch = Create a new branch somebranch and copy the content of master in it git checkout . = Cancel all changes not yet committed (but keep new files). Basically return the repository state to the last commit git cherry-pick SHA1_HASH = Apply the changes in the commit corresponding to SHA1_HASH. Commit can be on another branch (and usually it is). For multiple commits, it’s simpler to merge and then rebase git cherry-pick -X theirs SHA1_HASH = Apply the changes in the commit corresponding to SHA1_HASH. In case of conflicts, prefer the commit’s version to the current branch one. The reverse can be preferred with -X ours instead git stash = Save changes in the stash and return the repository to a clean state. Later they can be recovered and applied with git stash apply and shown with git stash show. To have a list of all changes in the stash use git stash list git stash -p = Interactively select which changes and files to stash git commit --amend = Modify the last commit message git commit --amend -a = Modify the last commit message and add also all new changes yet to be committed in it git rebase -i HEAD~3 = Permit to modify, delete or merge all the last 3 commits from the HEAD git blame file = Show all the editing done in file and who did it git bundle create somefile HEAD = Save the whole repository in somefile. To then import it back, use git pull somefile git bundle create somefile HEAD ^COMMON_SHA1 = As above but only from COMMON_SHA1 onward. This is useful when there’s an older version of repository, offline, that needs to be just updated with the latest commits git format-patch START_COMMIT = Create a patch that includes all changes from START_COMMIT till the HEAD. An email header is also generated, for quicker sending git format-patch START_COMMIT..END_COMMIT = As above but consider only the commits between START_COMMIT and END_COMMIT git diff START_COMMIT..END_COMMIT = Create a patch of commits between START_COMMIT and END_COMMIT. Unlike format-patch, it’s a plain patch ready to be used with patch git diff --unified=10 = Show 10 lines before and after a change instead of the default 3 git am \u003c patch = Apply patch to the repository git archive --format=tar --prefix=project-1.2.3/ -o outputfile HEAD = Save a tarball (or a zip if format is zip) of the whole repository in outputfile, with the given prefix, in the current directory, as is in HEAD git add -p = Allow to select which changes to include in the next commit git clean -x = Remove untracked and explicitly ignored files. With also n does a dry run, without actually removing anything git reflog = Show an extended log, including various operations like merges and checkouts, along with commits git filter-branch --index-filter 'git update-index --remove file' master = Completely remove file from the history, from the branch master, in every commit it appears. It’s like it never existed. To repeat for every branch in which the file was present git pull --rebase = Pull from a remote branch but don’t generate a commit message for the merge git show :/regexp = Show last commit message matching regexp git show \u003ccommitid\u003e:filename = show the status of filename at commitid git remote rename aaa bbb = Rename remote branch aaa to bbb git pull origin branch_remote:branch_local = Pull a remote branch in the local one, creating the latter if it didn’t already exist git merge --edit = Edit the commit message when doing a merge git merge --squash branch = Merge from branch in the current one, squashing all commits messages from when it diverged. After this, use git commit to record a single commit of changes git diff --word-diff = Highlights word changes, inline, instead of whole lines git status -sb = A more concise output for status git checkout -t origin/feature = Creates and checks out the local “feature” branch that tracks the remote “origin/feature” git name-rev --name-only COMMIT_SHA1 = Prints where the COMMIT_SHA1 is in the history, relative to a tag. It can output things like master~2 (commit is 2 commits before latest in master branch) or tags/v2.3~6 (commit is 6 tags before the one with tag 2.3) git branch -a --contains COMMIT_SHA1 = Shows all branches, and also remotes with -a, that have the given commit in their histories git show :/fix = Shows the last commit that contains the word “fix”. Also supports regexp, like :/^Test git log --diff-filter=D --summary = Show files, with the corresponding commits, that have been deleted git show commit:file = Show the full file as it was at commit git log -p --author=name = Show all commits whose author matches name (it may be a partial name or a regexp) git log -p master ^origin/master = Show a diff of what is new in master compared to origin/master. It is also possible to use multiple arguments, like git log -p master ^origin/master ^upstream/master git update-index --assume-unchanged file = Assume file is unchanged even if it’s not, excluding it from being committed. Re-enable the modifications then with git update-index --no-assume-unchanged file git ls-files = List all files tracked in the repo git push origin --delete branchname = Delete the remote branchname git cherry -v --abbrev testing master = Show a list of commits present in master but not in testing git clone --depth 1 = Clone only 1 revision in a repo’s history. To save space, mostly, or to send a quick patch or if you are only interested in the latest state of the project. A repository thus created can’t be cloned, fetched or pushed from or into it. git show branch-name:filename.js = Show filename.js as it currently is in branch-name git cherry-pick SHA1_HASH..SHA1_HASH = Apply changes in after the first hash till, including, the second one. To also include changes from first hash use SHA1_HASH^..SHA1_HASH format git remote set-url branch-name url = Set url of remote branch-name to url. Adding --push also changes the remote url to push to for specified branch git config --list --show-origin = list all configuration settings for Git, both global and local, and where each is set Cherry picking a range of commits Create a new branch from the branch where are the commits you want to apply by specifying the last wanted commit: git checkout -b newbranch SHA1_HASH_OF_COMMIT Then rebase from the older wanted commit into master: git rebase --onto master SHA1_HASH^ Github Sync with origin (the remote repository) after a local fork:\nCreate a local branch to be linked with the master of origin: git checkout -b origin/master Add the origin repository as a remote: git remote add origin git://github.com/username/repo.git Pull: git pull origin remote Checkout into local master: git checkout master Merge origin master in local master: git merge origin/master ",

If the images have an incorrect aspect ratio or there’s part of the image that isn’t desired to end up in the gif, crop with convert thus: L’area prescelta si calcola a partire dal vertice in alto a sinistra dell’immagine. Per selezionare da dove partire con il taglio impostare così: wwwXhhhx+nnn+nnn dove nnn sta per l’altezza e la larghezza da cui partire con il taglio e www e hhh per le dimensioni del taglio stesso\nfor jpegs in ./*.jpg; do convert -crop wwwXhhh+nn1+nn2 $jpegs crops/`basename $jpegs`; done where www is the width and hhh the height of the resulting image and nn1 and nn2 are respectively the height and width from where to start calculating the final width and height. For example, a source image of 1600x1200, using convert like 1400x1100+10+20 means that the final image will be 1400x1100 and it will be extrapolated 10 pixel from the left and 20 pixel from the top of the source image, thus excluding some part of it on the top and left. Then:\nconvert -adjoin -delay ms -resize 80×80! +map crops/* final.gif will create an animated gif (final.gif) with a delay between frames of ms, a size of 80x80 (here the ! means disregard aspect ratio and force resizing) and with optimized colours and transparency to reduce final size (+map)\nTweak brightness and contrast convert -level blackpoint%,whitepoint%,gamma blackpoint and whitepoint are the limit over which the black and white pixel will be discarded, in a percentage. Therefore, removing the blackest and/or whitest pixels can reduce the overall contrast of the image. Gamma increases or decreases the overall brightness. Default value is 1.0, lower it to dim and increases it to brighten\nAlternatively another command can be used, tweaking brightness and contrast at the same time:\nconvert original_image -brightness-contrast n%xm% final_image where n% refer to the increment or decrement in percentage of the brightness, and m% is relative to the contrast. Add a + or - to signal to ImageMagick if there has to be an increment or decrement.\nChange main colour of an icon convert \\( icon.png -alpha extract \\) -background \"#ffffff\" -alpha shape white-icon.png Convert an icon main colour, the foreground one, to white.

Use :he cterm-colors to see which colours can be used. Up until 256 colours, if the terminal supports it, can be used, see here\nRegexp Instead of backslashing special characters, it’s possible to add \\v at the very beginning of a regexp so that everything that’s not a letter, a number or an underscore is taken to have a special meaning unless explicitly escaped. For example:\n:%s/\\v^%(abc){1,3}(.+)$/\\1/ doesn’t need backslashing before parentheses, plus sign and curly brackets.\nAlso, \\c turns off case sensitivity. Its opposite is \\C, forcing case sensitivity on.\nIdentify corresponding opening/closing HTML tag Typing v + a + t will select everything inside the html tag where is the cursor. Subsequently o will jump between the opening and closing tag, c will change content and y will yank\nPlugins Other than using a plugin helper, from ViM 8 onward it is possible to install a plugin directly in the .vim/pack/ directory and load it without touching the configuration at all.\nIf the plugin is on Github, it can be automatically installed and set to autoload with this command:\ngit clone --depth 1 https://github.com/account/pluginname .vim/pack/dist/start/pluginname ",

    "content": " Linked List History Queues Dynamic Array Skip List Binary Tree BSP Tree Binary Indexed Tree Heap Associative Array Bit Array Trie Record Union Set Linked List A linked list is a collection of elements whose order is not given by the physical placement in memory but each element points to the next.\nEach element, or node, contains both data and a reference to the next node in the sequence. Inserting and removing elements is quicker than with arrays: there’s no need to rearrange the whole structure each time but:\na linked list use more memory (data + reference) nodes must be read in order longer access time as nodes are not contiguosly stored History First developed in 1955 for the IPL language. In 1958 linked lists were implemented in Lisp. The Flex family of file systems used doubly linked lists for their file structure, as the IBM’s T53/360 operating system.\nVersions:\nSingly Linked List a singly linked list contains nodes which have a data field and a next field, pointing to the next node in the list Doubly Linked List a doubly linked list contains, besides the next field and the data field, another link field that points to the previous node in the list. This is called the forward or backward or previous field Multiply Linked List a multiply linked list is like a doubly linked list, only with multiple number of fields pointing in different directions. Actually a doubly linked list is just a special case of a multiply linked list Circular Linked List in a circular linked list the last node, instead of being null, is a pointer to the head of the list, making it circular. It is also called open or linear list Unrolled Linked List a variation of a linked list in which each node stores multiple elements, in the form of arrays Association List an early implementation of an associative array, common in Lisp and later functional languages (Scheme, OCaml, Haskell). In Lisp is also called alist XOR Linked List an implementation of a doubly linked list that use bitwise XOR operation to store more efficiently the forward and backward field. It stores both in a single field by XORing the 2 fields’ addresses. To parse the list then it’s needed also the address of the 2 consecutive elements other than the XORed field of the current one. VList a singly linked list of arrays whose sizes decreases geometrically, from the first to the last. Usually the first array contains roughly half the total number of elements. A Sentinel Node may also be implemented as the first or last node instead of using null values, to speed up operations (removing the need for an expensive branch operation to check for null). It does not hold any data.\nEmpty lists are without data fields. Lists with only sentinel nodes are also considered empty.\nHash Linking are two arrays, one with the data and another with the links, both with the same indices.\nA Stack is a sort of a singly linked list which allows pop and push operations only on the first node, the top of the stack. Historically they have been invented in Munich and independently in Australia around 1954-1955. Stacks are commonly implemented through arrays and linked lists. They are LIFO, last in first out, data structure.\nQueues Similarly to stacks, queues are a collection of data in which addition is made at the back only and removal at the front only. These are respectively known as enqueque and dequeue operations. Doubly or singly linked lists are commonly used to implement queues.\nDeques or double-ended queues are queues in which elements can be added and removed both on front and back of the queue. Also known as head-tail linked list.\nPriority Queues are standard queues whose values are pre-ordered for priority, with the top value being the highest priority one.\nDynamic Array Also called growable array, resizable array, dynamic table, mutable array or array list is a data structure that is made of 2 parts of a fixed size array: the first stores the actual elements and the second is reserved. This makes very fast to add elements to the array afterwards, up until the total capacity of the array (size is called the size of the allocated elements).\nVariants:\nGap Buffer a dynamic array type that allows efficient insertion and deletion operations near the same location Hashed Array Tree (HAT) an hashed array tree has a top-level array where each element contains a power of two number of leaf arrays. All leaf arrays are the same size of the top level array (the directory). It’s similar to a hash table. It can hold at most m² elements, where m is the size of the directory Sparse Array an array in which most of the elements have the same value (the default value, usually 0 for array of numbers and null for array of objects) Multimap a generalization of a map or array in which more than 1 value may be associated and returned for a single key. Implementations are: container (C++), MultiMap (Java) Suffix Array a sorted array of all suffixes of a string. Also known as PAT array FM-index a suffix array that undergoes the Burrows-Wheeler transform of the input text. It is used to efficiently find the occurrences of a pattern within the text Judy Array a high performance, low memory usage implementation of an associative array. Judy arrays may be sparse, containing large ranges of unassigned indices. Similar to a highly optimised 256-ary trie Implementations:\nstd::vector (C++), ArrayList (Java and .Net), List\u003c\u003e (.Net 2.0), OrderedCollection (SmallTalk), list (Python)* Skip List Basically, a skip list is a normal linked list that has multiple levels, themselves linked lists. The bottom level is a linked list linking all elements, one after another; then the subsequent levels may link only the odd elements, jumping one or two at the time and so on up until the topmost level that usually links only the head to the middle and then the tail. They skip elements, thus the name.\nBinary Tree A binary tree is a data structure in which each node has at most 2 child nodes. Nodes with children are called parent nodes and there may exists a root node, the origin of all nodes. Definitions:\nroot is the top node child is a node directly connected to another parent is an immediate ancestor of a node siblings are nodes that share the same parent node neighbor is a parent or child node of another descendant is a node reachable by proceeding from parent to child ancestor is a node reachable by proceeding from child to parent. Also defined as a node n of node q if it exists on the path from root to node q. It is then a descendant of n leaf, or external, is a node with no children branch, or internal, is a node with at least one child edge the connection between one node and another path a sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant distance the number of edges on the shortest path between two nodes depth of a node is the length of the path from the root to the node. Sometimes called level depth of a tree is the length of the path from the root to the deepest node. Sometimes called height level is the number of edges between a node and root + 1 height is the number of edges on the longest path between a node and a descendant leaf width the number of nodes in a level breadth the number of leaves the height of tree is the height of root size of a node is the number of descendants it has, itself included in-degree of a node is the number of nodes arriving at that node out-degree of a node is the number of nodes leaving that node subtree is a node in a tree with all its descendants Variants:\nRooted Binary Tree a tree with a root node in which each leaf node has at most 2 children Full Binary Tree a tree in which every node, not only the leaves, has 2 children. More precisaly, every node has either 0 or 2 children. Also called proper binary tree, 2-tree or strictly binary tree Perfect Binary Tree a tree in which all leaves are at the same depth or same level and in which every parent has exactly 2 children Complete Binary Tree a tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled and all nodes are as far left as possible Balanced Binary Tree a tree in which the depth of the 2 subtrees of every node differ by 1 or less; more generally, it is a binary tree where no leaf is much farther away from the root than any other leaf. Degenerate Tree a tree where each parent node has only 1 child node. Basically not, performance-wise, a linked list Dancing Tree a self-balancing tree that balances its nodes only when flushing data to the disk, to gain performance by delaying optimization. Used in the Reiser4 filesystem B-tree a tree that’s not limited to 2 child nodes. Vastly used in databases and filesystems B+-tree a b-tree that stores copies of the keys in the internal nodes. Keys and records are normally stored in leaves. A leaf node may include a pointer to the next leaf node B*-tree the b*-tree balances more neighboring internal nodes to keep them more densely packed. It requires non-root nodes to be at least 2/3 full instead than 1/2. To achieve this, instead of splitting up a node when it gets full, its keys are shared with a node next to it. Only when both nodes are full they get split up in a third node B+tree as a b-tree but with usually large number of nodes and in which all nodes contain only keys (not pairs) and to which an additional level is added at the bottom with linked leaves Red-Black Tree a version of a balanced binary tree where each node is “painted” in two distinct colours, tipically red and black, in such a way that the resulting tree won’t be significantly unbalanced. Tracking the colour of every node it’s fast because it only requires 1 bit (just 2 colours). The root node is usually considered black, all leaves and the children of the same node are black too, the rest is red AA Tree named after its inventor, Arne Andersson, is a variant of a red-black tree that allows the red nodes to be added only in the right direction. No red node can thus be a left sub-child AVL Tree the first implementation of a balancing binary tree, named after its inventors (G.M.Adelson-Velskii and E.M.Landis) Splay Tree a self balancing tree that adds an operation, splaying, that rearranges the tree itself by putting a specific element as the root, making very quick to access it again 2-3 Tree a tree where every node with children has either 2 children and 1 data element or 3 children and 2 data elements. Nodes on the outside of of the tree, leaf nodes, have no children and 1 or 2 data elements. It’s similar to the AA tree 2-3-4 Tree a tree commonly used to implement dictionaries. Numbers mean a tree where every node with 2 children has either 2 children and 1 data element or 3 children and 2 data elements or 4 children and 3 data elements. Also called 2-4 tree Cartesian Tree a binary tree derived from a sequence of numbers. Each number has a node in the tree, with left nodes coming before the root in the sequence while the right subtree consists of later numbers. The tree has the heap property, the parent of any non-root node has a smaller value than the node itself Rope a binary tree used to store strings. Leaves contain a short string; each node has weight equal to the length of the string plus the sum of all the weight in its left subtree. Thus a node with 2 children divides the whole string in 2 parts: the left part stores the first part of the string, the right part stores the second part and its weight is the sum of the left child’s weight and the length of its contained string. Also called cord Threaded Binary Tree a binary tree that has all the right child pointers that would be normally be null point to the successor of the node and all the left child pointers, that would too be normally null, point to the predecessor of the node Ternary Tree a tree in which each node has at most 3 child nodes, usually called left, mid and right BSP Tree Paper on BSP (Binary Spacing Partitioning) Binary Indexed Tree A complete and clear answer on SO about the intuition behind a Binary Indexed Tree.\nHeap a tree that satisfies the heap property: if A is a parent node of B, then key(A) is ordered with respect to key(B). The same applies across the heap. Thus, either the keys of parent nodes are always greater than or equal to those of the children and the highest key is the root (this kind of heap is called max heap) or the keys of the parent node are less or equal to those of the children (min heap)\nVariants:\nBeap a data structure where every node has 2 parents and 2 children, unless it is the first or on the last level. Also known as bi-parental heap Binary Heap very similar to a binary tree but with two additional constraints: it is a complete binary tree, thus all levels are fully filled except maybe the last, and each node is greater or equal to each of its children, making thus a heap and not just a tree Fibonacci Heap a heap consisting of a collection of trees, even separated, satisfying the minimum-heap property (every child is always greater or equal to the parent) Leftist Heap a variant of a binary heap. Every node has an s-value which is the distance to the nearest leaf. Unlike binary heaps, a leftist heap (also called leftist tree) is very unbalanced and mantained so the right descendant of each node has the lower s-value 2-3 Heap a heap similar to the 2-3 tree d-ary Heap a generalization of a binary heap in which the nodes have d children instead of 2. Thus a binary heap is a 2-heap. Also simply called a d-heap Skew Heap a heap similar to a binary heap but without structural constraints. Only two conditions must be satisfied: the general heap order must be enforced and every operation on two skew heaps must be done using a special skew heap merge Implementations:\nmake_heap, push_heap and pop_heap (C++), java.util.PriorityQueue\u003cE\u003e (Java), heapq (Python), SplMaxHeap and SplMinHeap (Php), Heap (Perl), heap (Go)* Associative Array Also called map or dictionary is a collection of pairs (key, value) such that each keys appear at most once in the collection\nVariants:\nHash Table an associative array that uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots from which the correct value can be found. Hash collisions, different keys that are assigned by the function to the same bucket, can happen Implementations:\ndictionary (Smalltalk, Objective-C, .Net, Python), hash (Perl, Ruby), map (C++, Java, Go, Clojure, Scala), hash table (Common Lisp, PowerShell), table (Lua) Bit Array An array that stores bits, as in 0 or 1 values. Known also as bitmap, bitset, bit string, bit field or bit vector\nImplementations:\nbitfield (C), BitSet (Java), bitset (C++), BitArray (.Net) Trie Also called digital tree or prefix tree, the trie is used to store an associative array where keys are usually strings. Differently from a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated. All the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node, and the root is associated with an empty string. Values are associated with leaves, not every node.\nVariations:\nRadix Tree a space-optimized trie where each node with only one child is merged with its child, resulting in every internal node having 2 children. Also called patricia trie, _radix trie or compact prefix tree Suffix Tree a tree that presents the suffixes of a given string in a way that allows fast operations on it. Its edges are labeled with strings, such that each suffix of the string corresponds to exactly one path from the tree’s root to the leaf. The suffix tree is like a radix tree for the suffixes of a string B-Trie a trie that can store and retrieve variable-length strings efficiently on disk Record A value that contains other values, generally in fixed number, order and indexed by names. Record elements are called fields or members. Unlike arrays, records have fixed number of fields, all with a name, and with different types among them. Also called tuple, struct or compound data\nUnion Very similar to records, an union may have multiple elements but only one at the time can have a value as unions’ elements are stored at a single spot in memory and thus setting any value will overwrite all other elements’ values. As an advantage, they are clearly more compact than records.\nVariants:\nTagged Union an union that has a tag field that signals which type is in use and which field is active. Also known as variant, variant record, discriminated union, disjoint union or sum type Set A structure that can store any arbitrary value, in no particular order, and no repeated value. It can be static or frozen, not modifiable after the creation, or dynamic or mutable, that are modifiables.\nImplementations:\nSet (Java), NSSet and similar classes (Objective-C), set and frozenset (Python), HashSet and SortedSet (.Net), set (Ruby), Data.Set (Haskell) Variations:\nMultiset a generalization of a set, allowing repeated/duplicates values in either identical or different objects storing the same value. Also known as bag ",

They are also called then port-based VLANs. Any device attached to these ports will join the VLAN.\nDynamic VLANs instead are defined by physical addresses (MACs) of the devices or network account names and are not physically based.\nVLANs follow the IEEE 802.1Q standard that consists of 32bits added to the standard Ethernet frame header.\nDNS Basic concepts Autoritative NS: a server that has the domain’s data. If the server is not authoritative of the requested domain, it will point to another NS or serve cached copies of other NS Zone file: text file containing the mapping between domain names and IP addresses Root Servers: 13 main IP addresses of DNS servers, a to h, routed to the nearest mirror of the server Domain Level NS: the actual servers containing the records for the requested domains (think of ns1.domain.com, ns2.domain.com etc.) Resource Records A Record: map a host to an IP address. Example: host IN A 222.64.51.99 MX Record: map a mail exchange used for the domain. Example: IN MX 10 mail.domain.com., where 10 is the priority PTR Record: used for Reverse DNS lookups, map an IP address to a domain name. DNS Query A DNS query is a request for DNS resource records of a specified resource record type with a specified DNS name. DNS queries can be sent from a DNS client (resolver) to a DNS server, or between two DNS servers.\nThere are three types of DNS queries that may be sent to a DNS server: Recursive, Iterative and Authoritative-Only.\nRecursive Query: With a recursive name query, a DNS server is forced to respond to a DNS client request with either the requested resource record or an error message stating that the record or domain name does not exist. In this case, the DNS server will contact other DNS servers until it gets the information, or until the query fails. Iterative Query: With an iterative name query, the DNS client allows the DNS server to respond with the best answer it can give (the answer will be based on its cache or zone data). That may be as a referral to a better DNS server or a pointer to another DNS server authoritative for a lower level of the domain namespace. Authoritative-Only Query: the DNS server only answers those queries for which it stores the zones. Does not respond to recursive queries and cache query results. DNS Fields Example of the fields returning from a dig query:\nwww.someserver.com 300 IN A 192.30.30.165 Where the first is the domain name, the second the TTL, the third can be IN (Internet) or NS (Name Server) or MX (Mail Server) or CNAME (Canonical Name), the fourth is either A (IPv4) or AAAA (IPv6) and the last field is the IP address\nVPN Operates at OSI Layer 3 level (application independent). When operating with IPSec, it uses two modes: Transport or Tunnel. In the first, data is encrypted but headers are not, while in the latter both are.\nWhen operating with SSL/TLS, it uses OSI Layer 7 (application dependent then) in two modes: OpenVPN (Certificate/password-based, TCP) or Open Connect (DTLS, UDP).\nIP Addressing IPv4: 32bit address, composed of 4 octets ranging from 0 to 255 (256 numbers then). Theoretically though as the last .0 is considered the network IP and the last .255 is the broadcast IP, thus neither can be assigned to actual devices IPv6: 128bit address, composed of 8 hexadecimal numbers. The first half is considered the network part and the second the host part, derived by the MAC address of the device MAC: 48bit address, composed of 6 octets. The first 3 may be OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier), belonging to a specific organization, with the last 3 being local or NIC (Network Interface Specific) ",

From the latter there’s a slow ferry that can carry cars as well, cheaper. Otherwise, the usual speed boats are available.\nSome companies doing these routes are:\nMaruti Group Tours to Nusa Penida and Nusa Lembogan A lot of tours have early pick-up times (6-7am). Private tours are flexible in this regard.\nPrivate tour + snorkeling Private and full day with snorkeling Snorkeling Adventure Private and full day with snorkeling. Book on their website Kadek Nusa Penida Private Tour Private and short, without snorkeling Gili islands Three small islands next to Lombok with beautiful sandy beaches and easily walkable.\nGili Trawangan is the westernmost and liveliest of the three. It is a good spot to see sea turtles when the sea is calm.\nGili Memo, the middle one, is calm and geared towards romantic travellers. Not the cheapest in terms of accomodations.\nGili Air, the easternmost one, is the laid-back one.\nSnorkeling on all the Gilis can be done from the beach, no particular need of booking a tour. Usually the west side of each island has the strongest currents while the east the weakest. On Gili Air, right on the east cost, turtles can be spotted.\nTransportation to Gili islands From Bali, regular ferries leave from Sanur, Serangan and Padang Bai. The latter being the one with the most connections available. The whole trip is between 1,5hrs and 2,5hrs, depending on the type of ferry chosen. Some of the companies offering this trip are:\nEka Jaya - fairly big boat, leaving from Padang Bai Wahan Gili Ocean Scoot Fast Cruises - possibly with a stop on Lembogan on the way to the Gilis, leaving from Sanur Semaya One Ostina - medium boat, leaving from Padang Bai, not often recommended Blue Water Express - medium boat, leaving from Padang Bai, well-reputed There is also the possibility to reach the Gili islands by public ferry. This is the cheapest option, with a slow but fairly large boat (30+ persons). The trip takes about 6 hours.\nLabuan Bajo and Komodo To reach Komodo, a flight to Labuan Bajo on Flores is necessary. Then bus to Badjo and from there either a tour by boat or the ferry. A proper tour of Komodo island includes Padar and Pink Beach and takes a full day at least. It is not currently (2022) possible to go early in the morning to Labuan Bajo, do the tour, and be back on the same day on Bali.\nA couple of small islands near Labuan Bajo, remote, have great beaches and water:\nLe Pirate Kanawa Both can be reached by renting a boat from Labuan Bajo port. There’s nothing to do on these islands, being both just a resort on an otherwise uninhabited island.\nA list of officially accredited tour operators in Labuan Bajo is available.\nSome well-reputed operators are:\nLabuanbajoku Manumadi Indonesia Viaggi Your Flores Antavaya Long Lasting Trip Bintang Komodo Tours organizes tours to Komodo and around Flores from Bali Other islands Gili Layar is on the south-west of Lombok coast. It is quite remote and not developed at all. There’s a coral reef, plenty of beaches, and an atmosphere of a quiet, tropical island. Getting around Bali Perama offer modern buses that act as shuttles between the main places in Bali.\nGrab is an app alternative to Uber popular in Bali. Some drivers may take you off the main streets for fear of the taxi mafia. Similarly for Gojack app.\nA perhaps even cheaper way to book drivers and move around Bali is Klook app. Some reputed tour operators are on it as well.\nFrom the Airport is usually not possible to use any app but only a pre-booked driver or a taxi. There should be a Grab office as of 2022 to book a ride though. Alternatively, getting out of the airport and through the Novotel puts you on a side street where Grab/Gojack drivers can pick you up.\nSome reliable tour/driver companies:\nBaliMade Prices These are taxi prices and are an approximation. Updated as of summer 2022.\nUbud to Sanur = 100-125k IDR Airport to main touristic areas of Bali = 200-300k IDR Prices Updated as of mid 2022\nA sim card from Telkomsel prepaid should cost 100000IDR with 25Gb of data and 5G speed. Prepaid card can also be ordered online and picked up when in Bali.\nRenting a driver for the day should cost about 500kIDR for 12 hours.\nA speed boat + shuttle bus from one of the Gili islands to Bali and then to Ubud should cost between 450kIDR and 600kIDR per person.\nThings to do and try Try Martabak dessert. Watch Kecak Dance at Uluwatu temple. ",

    "content": " Cigars flavours Plants Spices and Herbs Earth and Minerals Fruits Nuts Flowers Other Not-Really-Flavor Flavors I am not an heavy smoker by any statistics. I dislike cigarettes and vaping, never got into weed even. But cigars, I like them. Very rarely I smoke one, more often the small ones, cigarillos, rather than the chunky ones. One every 2-3 weeks, at most.\nI am not a huge fan nor a conneisseur. But love to identify the different flavours in a cigar.\nCigars flavours Credit to Cigar Inspector.\nPlants This component does not have as many colorful descriptors as some of the other core components, but every cigar has at least one flavor from this section.\nGrass – often found in milder cigars, most notably those that are Connecticut Shade wrapped. Candela cigars because of the retained chlorophyll also often carry this flavor.\nHay – very similar to grass but with that extra barnyard component.\nMoss – a lot of mild cigars, generally from the DR and Honduras, can exhibit this flavor. It’s a cross between earth and grass with a bit of must. Puros Indios cigars have this flavor component.\nTea – one of those elusive flavors. Reportedly present in heavily aged cigars.\nTobacco – no stretch here that tobacco tastes like… tobacco. Usually this is used to describe a cigar that has a strong “tobacco core”. Cuban Partagas comes to mind.\nWood – this is a big component in tasting cigars. To me most cigars have some sort of woody component to it. This is most easily detected in milder cigars that are wrapped in Connecticut Shade leaves.\nCedar – a lot of cigars are cedar-aged (in humidors or en cedro) or boxed in cedar cabinets, so this is often a flavor that is imparted on the cigar after the leaves have been fermented and aged in the barns. Oak – some specialty cigars are oak cask-aged and some have this flavor naturally. It’s reminiscent of tannic qualities in wines, and is often accompanied with a dryness on the palate. Try the Aurora Barrel-Aged cigars for this flavor prominently on display. Smoky – when used it is referring to the flavor of smoked wood like hickory or mesquite. Vegetal – a general descriptor for a “green” plant-like flavor.\nSpices and Herbs This section will be a little broad in what is considered a spice or herb, but I see it as a good area to describe kitchen/baking flavors.\nAnise – see licorice. Cardamom Cinnamon – mostly the “hot” cinnamon variety, a similar feeling to eating a Red Hot candy. Cigars loaded with ligero can express this flavor. Clove Cumin – kind of smoky and woody (some say musky). Licorice – great flavor found once the sweet spot of the cigar is reached, often detected on the finish. Pepper – can be found in a lot of Corojo wrapped cigars (Camacho, Don Pepin, Tatuaje, etc.) as well as the heavy ligero cigars like the Joya de Nicaragua Antano and the La Flor Dominicana Ligero and Double Ligero. Look for further embellishment like white, red and black pepper. Spicy – this is kind of a weird one. It’s used liberally to describe a cigar that has full flavor, or is very strong, a peppery cigar or a cigar with a lot of the “kitchen” spices (cloves, cinnamon…). I tend not to use this as it can mean different things to different people. Earth and Minerals These flavor components have an elemental feel to them and are probably more a reflection of the country, region, soil composition and the fertilizers used in growing the tobacco plants.\nBarnyard – a combination of several flavors: grass, hay and earth often with some mustiness thrown in. Earth – a cigar that is described as earthy can have a few flavor components to it like soil (dirt), must, and even some deep vegetal flavors like moss and loam. I find this component most in Nicaraguan cigars. Lead – tastes like, well, lead. Embellished as pencil lead or graphite. Mineral – a general “mineraly-ness”, mostly lead. Must – this is a tough one. It’s kind of earthy and dusty but also has an aged feel to it. The best example is Cuban cigars. Cuban cigars = must. Salt – hopefully this isn’t the actual transfer of sweaty armpits carrying the bales of tobacco to our mouth… but this can be found in some cigars most notably Cubans, especially Punch. Fruits Unlike wine tasting, fruit flavors are not as prominent.\nCherry – I’ve heard this described occasionally and have only tasted it in a few cigars, and mostly in the finish. It’s usually a very subtle flavor to detect. Try La Flor Dominicana cigars, especially the Double Ligero line to pick up cherry. Citrus – usually a way to describe a cigar that has a certain “bite” to it. It can be both from improper fermentation and also from the tobacco itself. Most Don Pepin Garcia cigars have an acidic (or citrus) flavor component to them. Molasses – a very sweet flavor. Orange zest – quite a recognizable flavor Raisin – can’t say I really have ever picked up raisin notes, but many have. Nuts A prominent flavor in lots of cigars. A surprisingly wide variety of nuts can be detected in cigars. “Roasted” can often be thrown in front of these flavors to add a smoky element to them.\nAlmond – a great flavor found often on the finish. Cashew – this one is a bit of a stretch for me but I’ve seen it before in Cigar Aficionado… Marzipan – a sweet almond flavor. Peanut – every now and then I can get a peanut note in milder Connecticut Shade cigars. Peanut butter is also used descriptively. Pistachio – another CA fave. Walnut – a nuttiness that’s a little dry on the palate. Flowers In my opinion this is where wine and cigars diverge. Some cigars have a general “perfuminess”, but no flower flavors here. Maybe rose in the aroma if you’re stretching it. Others believe there are many cigars that have floral qualities, so it is included.\nFloral – a general “perfuminess”. Other This is a pretty broad category that will be used to describe a lot of other flavors or sensations that really don’t fall into the other categories.\nBread – an often disliked flavor. Can be further embellished as toast or dough. Char – a combination of flavors: meaty and smoky. Caramel – creamy caramelized sugar! Some Cameroons and H2000 wrappers can exhibit this flavor. Chocolate – this is a flavor I pick up more in the finish than in the initial inhale/exhale and is found often in Connecticut Broadleaf wrapped cigars. This can be further detailed as dark or milk chocolate and cocoa. Coffee – great flavor most often found in the finish and sweet spots. Can be embellished further as mild coffee, espresso, roasted coffee beans, café au lait (coffee w/ a creaminess), etc. Cream – not really the flavor of milk, but the general description of the type of flavors. Most creamy cigars are mild and most are of the Connecticut Shade variety. Honey – not sure where to put this, so it goes here. Described often in aged cigars. Leather – one of my favorite cigar flavor components. Leather “taste” really shows up in the exhale and finish and is tasted mostly through the nose. For some reason the Rosado shade yields the most leather flavor, so look for this in Opus X and Partagas Spanish Rosados. Meaty – the flavor of grilled hamburger comes to mind. A lot of rich maduros, especially from Nicaragua, can have this flavor. Mocha – a combination of chocolate and coffee flavors. This shows up often in the last third of a cigar once you reach the “sweet spot”. Musk – also known as the “animal” flavor. Sweet – there’s artificial sweet (sweet-tipped) and then there’s natural sweet. The natural sweetness is used to describe a cigar that has a general sugary flavor whether it be something like caramel, cocoa or marzipan. Many maduros are often described as sweet. Not-Really-Flavor Flavors This is a pretty broad category that will be used to describe a lot of other flavors or sensations that really don’t fall into the other categories.\nAcidic – see “Citrus” in the fruit section. Ammonia – not really a flavor, it’s actually what you are tasting – ammonia. Ammonia is a by-product of tobacco fermentation and improper fermentation and aging will result in a lot of ammonia left in the cigar. A huge turn-off for cigar lovers. Chewy – again, not really a flavor, more of an experience. A cigar where the smoke has an apparent texture to it in your mouth would be considered “chewy”. Dry – just like wines and tea, a cigar that has that tannic quality that dries out your mouth and teeth. Found mostly in Connecticut Shade cigars – think Davidoff. Cigar Aficionado hates this, but I’m a big fan. Harsh – not really a flavor per se, but definitely used to describe a cigar that may have one or several of the following components: ammonia, pepper and spice. Usually used to describe a cigar that is too young or unbalanced/muddled. ",

Why bothering trying to find love in others then? Not desiring friends: if no capability of dealing with strangers has been learned during childhood, it is hard to deal with friends’ necessities and requests. It is only too easy then to end up not respecting one’s borders, and growing resenting friends for this.

It has its quirks but lots of macros/plugins to customize the appearance of the content, and better format it.\nUseful Macros/Plugins Colgroup Tag + Column = great at showing two variants of code next to each other, it embeds the content into multiple columns. No header is supported but it can easily be added manually and formatted as desired. Tabs Container + Tabs Page = alternatively to columns, when different version of similar content aren’t necessarily needed to be shown together, tabs can be used. This macro support headers and will show like browser’s tabs. Not much in the way of customization by default but CSS code is supported. Section + Column = a default option to have the page’s layout split into columns. Content reusing in Confluence Multiple possibilities exist:\nInclude macro = can include a whole page into another. Excerpt and Excerpt-Include macros = can include pieces of content into another page. The big limitation is that content can be included only once. Multiexcerpt macro = works as the Excerpt macro above but doesn’t have the limitation of only including the content once. An useful tip to organize content for reusing is to have a page per excerpt under the root of the wiki, not under any space to hid the page from searches. A special title, like a prepended underscore, can be used to differentiate these pages from the others. The Include macro can then be used to include content from this sort of mini-library of excerpts elsewhere.\nAll the excerpt macros can be set to hidden to hid them in the page where they are created but not from the page where they are included.\nTips Categories are best used to connect and group similar spaces together. Space and page layouts work with the Apache’s Velocity template engine. Help \u0026 Manual Help \u0026 Manual is an XML-based help authoring tool for writing help/manual pages.\nMadCap Flare One of the main editor for technical writers, MadCap Flare is only a part of a suite of tools for helping writers creating single-source documentation.\nOxygen A suite of tools to create documentation from XML files. The main one is the XML Editor.\nSDL Triton A web content manager, semantic AI search and all around solution for content management.\nRoboHelp Adobe RoboHelp is Adobe’s effort for an help authoring tool.\nScribus As an open source tool, Scribus is one of the most widespread. It is an XML-based software, which can import and export to multiple formats.\nFramemaker Another Adobe tool, Framemaker is specifically designed to handle a large amount of documents, structured or not.\nDefault DITA xml elements available in Framemaker Topic = an element that consists of a single, self-contained subject matter. Concept = generally speaking, the Concept element can be considered as a “specialized topic”. It should be used when trying to answer all that is necessary to do or achieve something, in a descriptive, usually, way. Task = as with the Concept, a task is a specialized topic that answers how, procedurally, a task can be accomplished. It is more practical-oriented than a Concept and usually doesn’t include background info, as instead the Concept does. Reference = another specialized topic, it differs from both the Concept and Task as it neither provides background info or a step by step lists of practical actions. It is meant to show general information about a topic that can be useful, without explaining a specific task or topic, but being largely just informative. All the above elements are inserted into a new DITA xml file by selecting New DITA File in the menu and choosing the desired element from the submenu.\nHow to change background colour of a paragraph Select the paragraph Open the Paragraph Designer (Ctrl+M) Go to the advanced tab Change the colour, default is none, in the bottom right, under Pgf. Box The colour will be by default applied to all the successive paragraphs. Set it back to none to cancel this.\nPaligo An XML-based, web CCMS for technical documentation.\nBooktype An open source publishing software. Web-based, it is still available for download but it is not actively developed anymore.\nClickhelp A single-sourcing web-based documentation tool, with a large range of features.\nHelnNDoc A french publishing software, free for personal use, but only for Windows.\nMarkdoc A content authoring tool based off pure markdown files. It powers the praised Stripe documentation.\nAuthor-it An online content authoring cms built for eLearning courses and technical documentation.\nAstoria A DITA XML-based tool for content management.\nOvitas A range of solutions for document management, publishing, and automation.\nDocument360 A software for building knowledge base and online help documentation but not strictly limited to those.\nGood practices and procedures Developing a Doc Plan At the beginning of a project of any size, writing down a Doc Plan to help starting it out and following a fixed schedule. The plan will consists of:\nProduct Description: a brief summary of the product Audience: the audience the documentation is aimed to Deliverables: name, format and descriptions of all documents, including media files if present, that will be created Receivables: what you as a writer need from others (accesses, product versions, availability of experts that can answer your questions, templates etc.) Style: what style guidelines will be followed Tasks: list of actions required to complete the project and who is responsible for each of them Tools: what tools will be used Schedules: one for each deliverable Optionally, and especially when working for external clients, these points can be necessary as well:\nCopyright: who will own the copyright of the completed content Cost: a breakdown of the costs for each deliverable Disclaimer: add one that states that the ultimate responsibility for the accuracy of the content is of the client and/or developers Terms: payment schedule, cancellation policy and other legal terms ",

First to develop a New Testament canon. Then declared heretic and forced the orthodox Church to develop their own canon. Therapeautae = a Christian sect in Alexandria from 1st century a.C. Their practices were similar to Theravada Buddhism and their name may have been an adaption to Greek of the pali word Theravada. Random facts Pope Liberius in 354 a.C. first associated the winter solstice and roman celebration of Brumalia with the date of birth of Jesus Apocryphal books Book of Jubilees Book of Jubilees = only canon for the Ethiopian Church and the Ethiopian Jews. Condemned from the fourth century onward but before largely commented by Church Fathers. It is a rewriting of the Genesis and Exodus but with more details. Specifically narrates of the genesis of angels and how they gave birth to the Nephilims from human women. Angels come from Seth and the women from Cain. The Nephilims then generate the Elioud. Names 2 sisters of Seth and Cain, Awan and Azura. Cites hebrew as God’s language and the only one spoke in the original Garden, before Adam and Eve were cast out Book of Enoch Book of Enoch = dated around 300-200 b.C. till, the newer parts, 100 b.C., it is canon only for the Ethiopian and Eritrean churches. It only exists today in its ethiopian translation Initially considered canon by Church’s Fathers like Athegonaras, Clement of Alexandria, Irenaeus and Tertullian but then rejected as such in the fourth century a.C. Most of the book narrates the history of Enoch, his travels to heaven and his dreams. In the text also parables, an astronomical treaty (supposedly revealed to Enoch by God), a vision on Israel’s history and a series of letters. Integral text the angels, led by Samyaza, take as spouses human women and generate the Nephilims. one of the angel, Azazel, teaches many knowledges to humanity. God imprison all the angels that descended to Earth by other angels. Apocryphal Gospels Generally the canonical Gospels started to be considered so only in the second half of the second century a.C.\nOnly around 190 a.C. the word “New Testament” is first used, distinct from the Old. Before that date, the various Gospels, apocryphals or not were considered text more or less truthful, but not of divine inspiration, and the Old Testament was considered the only sacred text.\nGospel of James Gospel of James = perhaps autobiographical, it is attributed to a son of Saint Joseph from a previous wife. dated between 150 and 200 a.C. (first mentioned in the third century by Origen of Alexandria). asserts the virginity of Mary before and after the birth of Jesus. first mention of the nativity happening in a cave. explicitly asserts that Saint Joseph had several children, being a widower. claims the old age of Saint Joseph at the birth of Jesus. tells the infancy of Mary in a temple, also confirmed in the Qu’ran. Infancy Gospel of Thomas Infancy Gospel of Thomas = not canonical for any Church today, it is thought to be Gnostic in origin. Rejected as heretical since the beginning of Christianity, it contains many miracles and stories about Jesus that are accepted as true in the Qu’ran. not of Saint Thomas. first cited by Irenaeus around 185 a.C. The earliest possible autorship date is 80 a.C. but is generally agreed upon on a mid second century date. the text tells of many childish miracles of Jesus, even tricks, some of which are confirmed by the Qu’ran. Jesus is depicted as a rebel child, unheedful of the advice of his parents 2 children and their teacher die due to a curse of Jesus Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew = originally considered written by Saint Matthew himself but not anymore. Focuses on the infancy of Jesus and Mary. a late text, from around 600-625 a.C. influencial in the Middle Age pictorial of Nativity, first mention of the ox and donkey at the birth of Jesus. Gospel of the Ebionites Gospel of the Ebionites = surviving only in fragments, it is an apocryphal Gospel of Jewish-Christian origin. dated around the middle of second century a.C. mostly quoted by Epiphanius, the bishop of Salamis, Cyprus. important teological take is the assertion that the Holy Ghost enters Jesus as a dove at the moment of his baptism. Only from there he’s considered the son of God. Gospel of the Hebrews Gospel of the Hebrews = another Jewish-Christian Gospel, perhaps composed in Greek by the local commmunity in Egypt. Only citations from the Church Fathers of it exist today. considered canonical until the New Testament canon was formed in fourth century a.C. dated around the second century a.C. narrates many events of the early life of Jesus, until its baptism and death. the Holy Ghost is the “Divine Mother” of Jesus, feminine, following an ancient jewish tradition. James the Just, the stepbrother of Jesus, is the head of the Jerusalem Church and present at the Last Supper. other stepbrothers of Jesus are cited as among his followers. Gospel of the Nazarenes Gospel of the Nazarenes = last of the Jewish-Christian Gospels, along with the Hebrews and Ebionites it is perhaps a single text. dated before 200 a.C. but the full text doesn’t exist anymore. Its existence was inferred by citations of Church Fathers. written in hebrew. it is considered one of the sources of the canonical Gospel of Matthew. Gospel of Marcion Gospel of Marcion = written by Marcion of Sinope as a relaboration of various Gospels, mostly as an edited version of the Gospel of Luke. around 2nd century a.C. declared eretical on 144 a.C. only a few fragments remain. an hypothesis is that Marcion’s Gospel predates Luke and is thus the very first Gospel. Jesus didn’t follow the tradition of the prophets. the Earth is considered evil. Gospel of Mani Gospel of Mani = also known as the living Gospel, is a Gnostic Gospel written by Mani. a few fragments remain of the original 22 parts. thought as a Gnostic Gospel that should have replaced all the other Gospels. the Manicheans adopted it as the only true Gospel. Gospel of Peter Gospel of Peter = of an unknown author but assumed to be Peter the apostle and the Gospel itself claims so. around second century a.C. declared heretical at the councils of Carthage and Rome, when the canonical New Testament was formed. Mostly accused of being docetic. possibly not influenced by any of the other 4 canonical Gospels. the nearly complete text was found in 1886 in Egypt. in it, Pontius Pilate is lifted from any blame: only Herod and the Jews are culpable for the death of Jesus. Jesus had not a physical body and thus possessed a pure spirit. It follows that he couldn’t die and neither resurrect. Jesus is brought to the sky along with the cross, which is a talking cross. Angels of gargantuan size are present at the crucifixion. Jesus travels to Hell. Gospel of Nicodemus Gospel of Nicodemus = also known as the Acts of Pilate, is a Gospel derived from an original Hebrew work written by Nicodemus, an associate of Jesus. dated around the fourth century a.C. the section talking about Pilate is an original greek text that narrates the supposedly official report that Pilate did to emperor Claudius of the events surrounding the crucifixion of Jesus. Jesus travels to Hell. it is hinted of a conversion or repentance of Pilate. Questions of Bartholomew Questions of Bartholomew = a late Gospel in a similar style to the Apocalypse of St. John. It is framed as a discussion between Jesus and the apostles, spurred by many questions of Bartholomew. could be the same text as the Gospel of Bartholomew. copies in greek, latin and old slavonic still existing. Integral text. there is a sort of testimony of Satan about his rebellion. A son of Satan, Salpsan, is named in the greek version. Jesus narrates his travel to Hell and angels open the Earth to let the apostles see it themselves. Salpsan is compared to Cain in accounts where this is sired by a fallen angel, Samael, that had been seduced by Eve. Apocryphon of James Apocryphon of James = also known as the Secret Book of James, it mainly tells of the teachings given by Jesus to James and Peter after the resurrection. probably written in the first half of the second century a.C. it shows affinities with Gnosticism but has not clearly attributed to any Gnostic sects. Integral text. the text is framed as a letter written by James to an unknown destinatary. only Peter and James are given these additional teachings from Jesus and only James comprehend them in full. both Peter and James are invited in Heaven by Jesus but neither understand the invite, as they are distracted by the questions of the other apostles. it is hinted that James is the heir of Jesus as the head of the apostles. Book of Thomas the Contender Book of Thomas the Contender = simply known also as the Book of Thomas. a scribe named Matthias is the one who actually writes the text. It is thought from this then that it may be the lost Gospel of Matthias. quite metaphoric in tone, and similar to many gnostic texts. it is stressed the importance of fighting evil with good. important is also trying to overcome ego lusts and attachments. Dialogue of the Savior Dialogue of the Savior = another Gnostic text, heavily damaged. largely edited and confusing, with sections apparently not connectd with the main text. the final version may have been redacted around 150 a.C. Thomas, Mary and Matthew are shown Hell from the border of the Earth and an angel explains them that the Earth itself was not a willingly create world and inherently evil. controlling carnal desires is important (literrally called “the works of femininity”) it is partly a dialogue with Jesus, which abruptly mid-text is stopped being called Lord and is instead addressed as Savior. Gospel of Judas Gospel of Judas = a Gnostic Gospel, probably composed by Gnostic christians rather than Judas himself. dated to second century a.C. due to the only existing copy found in Egypt was carbon dated to 280 ± 60 years. it is thought that it was written in Coptic from an original Greek text. around a third of the text is currently illegible. Judas is seen as a positive figure instead of a negative one, and the only apostle that understood Jesus’ teachings in full. many heretical claims are made throughout the text, which is often in stark contrast to contemporary canonical an apocryphal Gospels. God is described as a “luminous cloud of light”, living in an imperishable realm. Adamas was created as the father of all humanity, and lives along God in the same realm. 12 original angels were created and in turn they made a physical body for Adamas, the one known therefore as Adam. humanity forgot the existence of Adamas and that imperishable realm, thinking that Earth is the only realm that exists. lesser gods were also created in the beginning, along with the angels. Jesus was the true son of God, not one of these lesser gods. embracing the internal God in all humanity is the way to salvation. the other Apostles did not understand the spiritual teachings of Jesus and were instead obsessed with the material realm. They spread the cult of lesser gods, practicing wrong acts like animal sacrifice and martyrdom. humanity is split into two big groups: those with a soul, that after death will be reconciled with the true God and live forever, and those without, that will die, body and spirit, once and for all. the communion is compared to cannibalism. the death of Jesus had nothing to do with saving humanity but it was a simple method to return to God. sacrifices are never coming from the true God, who is fully benevolent, but by the lesser ones. Judas is the favorite apostle and not at all a traitor. His function was known to Jesus and in accord with his wishes. Judas doesn’t die by hanging himself but is lapidated by the other apostles, thinking him a villain. Full text as translated by the National Geographic. Gospel of Mary Gospel of Mary = not considered an actual Gospel but a general text of the early Christianity. from an original text written in Greek around the second century a.C. it was suggested it may have been actually written during the time of Christ. it was found in Egypt in 1896. it is uncertain whether the name Mary is referred to the mother of Jesus, Mary Magdalene or one of Jesus’ own sisters (named Mary in the Gospel of Philip). the remaining parts contain discourses between Mary and the apostles. the self of each human being is composed of a soul, a spirit/mind and a third mind. not all the apostles are convinced by the revelations that Mary does to them. Peter is offended that Mary was chosen as the favorite by Jesus instead of him. Gospel of Philip Gospel of Philip = another Gnostic Gospel, it was lost during medieval times until it was rediscovered in Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945. dated to around the third century a.C. or between 180 and 300 a.C. probably not written by Philip the apostle, as he died in 80 a.C., but the text doesn’t claim to be either. a large part of the content is about sacraments. a big part of the text is about the relationship between Mary Magdalene and Jesus, and their close relationship. Mary Magdalene is multiple times called Jesus’ companion, partner or consort. marriage is called a sacred mystery. a sister of Jesus is named, as confirmed by the canonical Gospel of Mark (6:3). It is unclear whether it is an actual sister of Jesus or a sister of his mother, thus an aunt of Jesus it is narrated of a kiss between Jesus and Mary Magdalene, again, in uncertain form, and how Mary Magdalene had a privileged spot among the apostles and how this caused some resentment. Greek Gospel of the Egyptians Greek Gospel of the Egyptians = not to be confused with the Coptic Gospel of the Egyptians, is a gospel whose name cames from its opening line. dated around the second quarter of the second century a.C. only fragments remain today. it was canonical in Egypt between the second and the third century a.C. it is written in form of dialogues between the disciple Salome and Jesus. Jesus advocates celibacy, or actual sexual ascetism, as a way to break the cycle of birth and overcoming the alleged sinful differences between men and women, coming back to an androginous state that was the original one for all humanity. Jesus famously answer to the question “How long shall death prevail?” with: “As long as women bear children”. Gospel of Truth Gospel of Truth = a Gnostic Gospel, which actually lacks a proper name but is named after the very first three words of the text more an homily than a Gospel, written in heavily poetic form. probably written originally in Greek between 140 and 180 a.C. possibly by Valentinus himself. content starts with the cause of the creation of the world: ignorance. Jesus was sent by God to correct this, reuniting the aeons and humanity with God. it describes ignorance as a nightmare, that prevents us from knowing God and attaining salvation. there is no need for God to save humans as every person has inside the seed for salvation, through knowledge alone. this “gospel” does not describe the life of Jesus by comes from teachings given by him in the 40 days after the resurrection. Pistis Sophia Pistis Sophia = a Gnostic text, from an original Coptic manuscript of 178 pages discovered in 1773 probably written between the third and fourth century a.C. Sophia would be an important feminine divinity in many Gnostic texts, possibly a feminine version of either Christ himself or the Holy Ghost much of the content is in the form of questions from the Apostles to Jesus. Mary Magdalene is heavily feaured, appearing in a major role among the apostles. Jesus remains 11 years after the resurrection to teach the apostles, the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalene and Martha. After these 11 years Jesus receives “higher garments” and teaches higher mysteries related to cosmology and other necessary knowledges to attain salvation. 32 carnal desires are cited to be overcome to be saved. Full text. Second Treatise of the Great Seth Second Treatise of the Great Seth = a Gnostic Gospel found among the Nag Hammadi library texts. the Seth referenced in the title doesn’t appear in the content. dated around the third century a.C. the Seth of the title is the third son of Adam and Eve, the one initiated to gnostic mysteries. Jesus was not crucified, Simon of Cyrene was mistaken for him and got crucified in his place. Jesus is described as standing by the place of the crucifixion and “laughing at their ignorance”. the text is written in the first person perspective of Jesus. the text laughs at those believing that Jesus was crucified and to all the believers of the previous prophets (like Adam, Abraham, Isaac, Moses and so on). the God of the Jews is not the true God but only the Demiurge. Jesus is claimed to never have been a man but a pure docetistic spirit. Jesus claimed a body of an human man and took it for his own use. Apocryphon of John Apocryphon of John = a gnostic Gospel, known to Irenaeus. written before 180 a.C. found in Egypt in 4 Coptic manuscripts, translated from the original Greek version. it narrates a revelation of Jesus after the resurrection to John the Apostle. the highest divine principle is named as the Monad. a feminine divinity named Barbelo is produced by the Monad, after his thought. Barbelo is the first of a class of divinity, the Aeons. Sophia, one of the Aeons, produces with a male consort the first of demonic entities named the Archons, Yaltabaoth, disrupting the harmony that reigned before. Sophia repents though, and the Monad and the other Aeons help her to redeem the Archons. During this process, Adam is created. The Garden of Eden is a false paradise, as the Tree of Life is only a part of the larger Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. Jesus reveals to have been him to have caused Adam to consume the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. Within Adam there is the essence of Light and Eve is created in an attempt to extract this essence out of him. Yaltabaoth keeps humanity in check by making them reproduce and inserting into them a counterfeit spirit. Through ignorance, humanity is kept away from the Aeons and the Monad, and subject to the Archons. Apocalypse of Paul Apocalypse of Paul = a Gospel narrating the vision of heaven and hell by the apostle Paul. Not to be confused with the unrelated text Coptic Apocalypse of Paul. the original Greek version is lost. dated around the fourth century a.C. based off the Apocalypse of Peter but expanding on it. Syriac, Amharic, Coptic and Georgian versions exists, along with an Ethiopian one which differs in making the Virgin Mary the one experiencing the vision. pride is cited as the root of all evil. the paradise is the land of milk and honey. Paul obtains from God a rest for the damned on every Sunday. First Apocalypse of James First Apocalypse of James = a Gnostic apocalypse. dated to the early third century a.C. the text is a dialogue James the Just, named as the brother of Jesus, and Jesus. They are not biological brothers though, being born of different mothers and fathers. James is subject to martyrdom by crucifixion. A few “passwords” are given to him before the martyrdom so he can ascend to the highest heaven, out of 72 in total, after death, without being blocked by the Demiurge. James is the early head of the Church. James is the most senior apostle. Integral text. Second Apocalypse of James Second Apocalypse of James = a Gnostic Gospel describing the martyrdom of James the Just. dated to the second century a.C. the father of James is named Theudas, not Joseph. The mother is named Mary but it is not specified in the text if this is the same Virgin Mary or another Mary. in contrast with the First Apocalypse of James, the text here explicitly say that James and Jesus share the same mother, although it is not stated that this mother is the same Mary. Jesus and James share a kiss on the lips, in a probably metaphor for the passing of Gnosis between them. Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius = a late Christian eschatological text. written in Syriac in the seventh century a.C. the work attempts to make sense of the recent Islamic conquests. typical messianic elements of the tale of Gog and Magog, the rise of the Antichrist and the tribulations before the end of time are present. another messianic element is added though, in the character of a messianic Roman emperor, Saviour of the christians against the army of Ishmael (the Islamic Empire). Apocalypse of Peter Apocalypse of Peter = an early Christian text with an apocalyptic tone. mentioned in the Muratorian fragment, the oldest surviving list of New Testament books. It is reputed a true Gospel in the fragment but also stated that some authorities would not have it read in church. dated to the second century a.C. two versions exist, a Koine Greek and an Ethiopian one. This latter version has included later texts and diverges from the original considerably. another version exists in Arabic, the Ru’ya Butrus. the text is framed as a discourse between Jesus after the resurrection and the Apostle. A first vision of heaven and hell is granted to Peter. a description of people in heaven (with milky white skin, curly hair and wearing shiny clothes) and of the torments given to the sinner in hell is given. at the end of time every soul in hell will be pardoned thanks to the prayers of the souls in heaven but it is best if this remains a secret.

In the philosophy of mind realm, Eliminativism means the denial of existence of various states of the mind, such as belief or desire. It postulates how no scientifical basis for the existence of these states will ever be found.\nOther versions include also pain or visual perceptions in this denial.\nThis current of thought originates in the 1960-1970s.\nEliminativism is in direct contrast with common physicology, asserting how it has roughly failed and most of it will be corrected/negated by neuroscience and developments of artificial intelligence. Original eliminativists considered both true that some mental states didn’t exist and that they could be explained in terms of lower-level neurophysiological states. Modern ones tend to think more on the complete denial of many mental states, rather that using neuroscience as an explanation.\nNotable philosphers of Eliminativism Wilfred Sellars W.V. Quine Paul Feyerabend Richard Rorty B.F. Skinner Paul and Patricia Churchland Daniel Dennett References Main Wikipedia’s page about Eliminativism Moral Nihilism The view that asserts that there is nothing morally right or wrong. It opposes traditional views in which moral proprieties or methods hold objectively and from which we can decide the morality of our actions. For the moral nihilists such proprieties do not exist in the world, therefore the traditional meaning of morality does not exists as well.\nMoral assertions can be true or false only if there are moral proprieties. Once those are rejected, it is logical that the former cannot exist.\nNotable philosophers of Moral Nihilism J. L. Mackie Existential Nihilism The philosophical theory that life has no meaning and that humanity has no purpose. This includes both us as a society and the individual. The capacity of purpose is not denied, it is only assumed that none is given or inherent to objects and humans.\n",
