<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Thomas_the_Contender">Book of Thomas the Contender</a> = simply known also as the <strong>Book of Thomas</strong>.
<ul>
<li>a scribe named Matthias is the one who actually writes the text. It is thought from this then that it may be the lost Gospel of Matthias.</li>

<li>important is also trying to overcome ego lusts and attachments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dialogue-of-the-savior">Dialogue of the Savior</h3>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gospel-of-judas">Gospel of Judas</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Judas">Gospel of Judas</a> = a Gnostic Gospel, probably composed by Gnostic christians rather than Judas himself.
<ul>
<li>dated to second century a.C. due to the only existing copy found in Egypt was carbon dated to 280 ± 60 years.</li>
<li>it is thought that it was written in Coptic from an original Greek text.</li>
<li>around a third of the text is currently illegible.</li>
<li>Judas is seen as a positive figure instead of a negative one, and the only apostle that understood Jesus' teachings in full.</li>
<li>many heretical claims are made throughout the text, which is often in stark contrast to contemporary canonical an apocryphal Gospels.</li>
<li>God is described as a &ldquo;luminous cloud of light&rdquo;, living in an imperishable realm.</li>
<li>Adamas was created as the father of all humanity, and lives along God in the same realm.</li>
<li>12 original angels were created and in turn they made a physical body for Adamas, the one known therefore as Adam.</li>
<li>humanity forgot the existence of Adamas and that imperishable realm, thinking that Earth is the only realm that exists.</li>
<li>lesser gods were also created in the beginning, along with the angels.</li>
<li>Jesus was the true son of God, not one of these lesser gods.</li>
<li>embracing the internal God in all humanity is the way to salvation.</li>
<li>the other Apostles did not understand the spiritual teachings of Jesus and were instead obsessed with the material realm. They spread the cult of lesser gods, practicing wrong acts like animal sacrifice and martyrdom.</li>
<li>humanity is split into two big groups: those with a soul, that after death will be reconciled with the true God and live forever, and those without, that will die, body and spirit, once and for all.</li>
<li>the communion is compared to cannibalism.</li>
<li>the death of Jesus had nothing to do with saving humanity but it was a simple method to return to God.</li>
<li>sacrifices are never coming from the true God, who is fully benevolent, but by the lesser ones.</li>
<li>Judas is the favorite apostle and not at all a traitor. His function was known to Jesus and in accord with his wishes.</li>
<li>Judas doesn&rsquo;t die by hanging himself but is lapidated by the other apostles, thinking him a villain.</li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060408153348/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/lostgospel/_pdf/GospelofJudas.pdf">Full text as translated by the National Geographic</a>.</li>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Mary">Gospel of Mary</a> = not considered an actual Gospel but a general text of the early Christianity.

<li>it is uncertain whether the name Mary is referred to the mother of Jesus, Mary Magdalene or one of Jesus' own sisters (named Mary in the <strong>Gospel of Philip</strong>).</li>
<li>the remaining parts contain discourses between Mary and the apostles.</li>
<li>the self of each human being is composed of a soul, a spirit/mind and a third mind.</li>
<li>not all the apostles are convinced by the revelations that Mary does to them. Peter is offended that Mary was chosen as the favorite by Jesus instead of him.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Philip">Gospel of Philip</a> = another Gnostic Gospel, it was lost during medieval times until it was rediscovered in Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945.
<ul>
<li>dated to around the third century a.C. or between 180 and 300 a.C.</li>
<li>probably not written by Philip the apostle, as he died in 80 a.C., but the text doesn&rsquo;t claim to be either.</li>
<li>a large part of the content is about sacraments.</li>
<li>a big part of the text is about the relationship between Mary Magdalene and Jesus, and their close relationship. Mary Magdalene is multiple times called Jesus' companion, partner or consort.</li>
<li>marriage is called a <strong>sacred mystery</strong>.</li>
<li>a sister of Jesus is named, as confirmed by the canonical Gospel of Mark (6:3). It is unclear whether it is an actual sister of Jesus or a sister of his mother, thus an aunt of Jesus</li>
<li>it is narrated of a kiss between Jesus and Mary Magdalene, again, in uncertain form, and how Mary Magdalene had a privileged spot among the apostles and how this caused some resentment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="greek-gospel-of-the-egyptians">Greek Gospel of the Egyptians</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Gospel_of_the_Egyptians">Greek Gospel of the Egyptians</a> = not to be confused with the <strong>Coptic Gospel of the Egyptians</strong>, is a gospel whose name cames from its opening line.

<li>only fragments remain today.</li>
<li>it was canonical in Egypt between the second and the third century a.C.</li>
<li>it is written in form of dialogues between the disciple Salome and Jesus.</li>
<li>Jesus advocates celibacy, or actual sexual ascetism, as a way to break the cycle of birth and overcoming the alleged sinful differences between men and women, coming back to an androginous state that was the original one for all humanity.</li>
<li>Jesus famously answer to the question &ldquo;How long shall death prevail?&rdquo; with: &ldquo;As long as women bear children&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gospel-of-truth">Gospel of Truth</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Truth">Gospel of Truth</a> = a Gnostic Gospel, which actually lacks a proper name but is named after the very first three words of the text
<ul>
<li>more an homily than a Gospel, written in heavily poetic form.</li>
<li>probably written originally in Greek between 140 and 180 a.C.</li>
<li>possibly by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentinus_(Gnostic)">Valentinus</a> himself.</li>

<li>Sophia, one of the Aeons, produces with a male consort the first of demonic entities named the Archons, Yaltabaoth, disrupting the harmony that reigned before.</li>
<li>Sophia repents though, and the Monad and the other Aeons help her to redeem the Archons. During this process, Adam is created.</li>
<li>The Garden of Eden is a false paradise, as the Tree of Life is only a part of the larger Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.</li>
<li>Jesus reveals to have been him to have caused Adam to consume the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge. Within Adam there is the essence of Light and Eve is created in an attempt to extract this essence out of him.</li>
<li>Yaltabaoth keeps humanity in check by making them reproduce and inserting into them a counterfeit spirit. Through ignorance, humanity is kept away from the Aeons and the Monad, and subject to the Archons.</li>
