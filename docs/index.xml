I am more of a backend guy. But inevitably frontend stuff is necessary to know these days and thus I learned a few. Mostly back in the days of frontend being just HTML+CSS.</description></item><item><title>Languages</title><link>https://donearm.github.io/Personal-Wiki/languages/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://donearm.github.io/Personal-Wiki/languages/</guid><description>Languages here stands for &amp;ldquo;programming languages&amp;rdquo;. There are more that I played with when I was actively doing programming but here I saved only the bits I actually used and found useful to save for later re-use.</description></item><item><title>Operating Systems</title><link>https://donearm.github.io/Personal-Wiki/operating_systems/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://donearm.github.io/Personal-Wiki/operating_systems/</guid><description>90% of this section is Linux and Unix-like systems.

After a few years of professional work, I found the desire to know more about the theory behind what I was doing and started following a few courses and reading books about CS Theory.
The results of what I learned are here.</description></item><item><title>Various</title><link>https://donearm.github.io/Personal-Wiki/various/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://donearm.github.io/Personal-Wiki/various/</guid><description>As you may not surprisingly have imagined, here there are piece of my knowledge that don&amp;rsquo;t fit under the other categories and aren&amp;rsquo;t that large to warrant their own section.</description></item><item><title>Travels</title><link>https://donearm.github.io/Personal-Wiki/travels/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://donearm.github.io/Personal-Wiki/travels/</guid><description>One of my favourite pastimes has always been traveling. And when I am not traveling, I plan the next trip.
Over time I collected a wealth of info about the best places to go, what to visit, where to eat, where to stay, and transportation tips over a large amount of places around the world. A lot I have deleted because terribly outdated. What is left are the timeless parts.</description></item><item><title>History</title><link>https://donearm.github.io/Personal-Wiki/history/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://donearm.github.io/Personal-Wiki/history/</guid><description>I am an history fan. One of the first book I read was the Cambridge University History of Ancient World. A long series of tomes about the history of the ancient civilizations. It was even before high school, so I kind of was reading ahead of the curriculum.
Over the years I have been reading nearly one third of all books as history books. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been keeping many notes, confiding much on my memory.</description></item><item><title>Hobbies</title><link>https://donearm.github.io/Personal-Wiki/hobbies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://donearm.github.io/Personal-Wiki/hobbies/</guid><description>I don&amp;rsquo;t have many hobbies. Nor much time to develop them. But what I like to do in my free time is discussed in this section.</description></item><item><title>Health</title><link>https://donearm.github.io/Personal-Wiki/health/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://donearm.github.io/Personal-Wiki/health/</guid><description>Just random health notes. Mainly about mental health. Not necessarily what applies to myself, only general annotations that I find worthy to save.</description></item><item><title>Philosophy and Religion</title><link>https://donearm.github.io/Personal-Wiki/philosophy_and_religion/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://donearm.github.io/Personal-Wiki/philosophy_and_religion/</guid><description>After history and fantasy, the third topic I like to read the most is Philosophy and Religion.</description></item><item><title>Writing</title><link>https://donearm.github.io/Personal-Wiki/writing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://donearm.github.io/Personal-Wiki/writing/</guid><description>Not a large section yet, as most of my actual writing is elsewhere.
