      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bits and pieces about what I learned in my brief stint as a DevOps Engineer&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Frontend</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was never good at frontend. I am more of a backend guy. But inevitably
frontend stuff is necessary to know these days and thus I learned a few. Mostly
back in the days of frontend being just HTML+CSS.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Programming Languages</title>
      <link>https://donearm.github.io/Scientia/programming_languages/index.html</link>

      <guid>https://donearm.github.io/Scientia/programming_languages/index.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to be a language freak, trying to learn any new cool language. Then I
stopped, as following them all was an excessively time-consuming, and
pointless, task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, there are more that I played with when I was actively doing
programming but here I saved only the bits I actually used and found useful to
save for later re-use.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://donearm.github.io/Scientia/operating_systems/index.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;90% of this section is Linux and Unix-like systems. Windows I only tolerate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not just programs but also a few protocols. Generally though, anything that is
specific about a single software goes here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Computer Science Theory</title>
      <link>https://donearm.github.io/Scientia/theory/index.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://donearm.github.io/Scientia/theory/index.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a self-taught programmer, I didn&amp;rsquo;t follow a structured learning system but
learned by testing, practicing, and breaking things. After a few years of
professional work, I found the desire to know more about the theory behind what
I was doing and started following a few courses and reading books about CS
Theory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of what I learned are here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Travels</title>
      <link>https://donearm.github.io/Scientia/travels/index.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://donearm.github.io/Scientia/travels/index.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite pastimes has always been traveling. And when I am not
traveling, I plan the next trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time I collected a wealth of info about the best places to go, what to
visit, where to eat, where to stay, and transportation tips over a large amount
of places around the world. A lot I have deleted because terribly outdated.
What is left are the timeless parts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>History</title>
      <link>https://donearm.github.io/Scientia/history/index.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://donearm.github.io/Scientia/history/index.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am an history fan. One of the first book I read was the Cambridge University
History of Ancient World. A long series of tomes about the history of the
ancient civilizations. It was even before high school, so I kind of was reading
ahead of the curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years I have been reading nearly one third of all books as history
books. I haven&amp;rsquo;t been keeping many notes, confiding much on my memory. Old age
is approaching so I recently started saving pieces of info that I find
interesting here.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://donearm.github.io/Scientia/hobbies/index.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have many hobbies. Nor much time to develop them. But what I like to do
in my free time is discussed in this section.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Health</title>

      <guid>https://donearm.github.io/Scientia/health/index.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just random health notes. Mainly about mental health. Not necessarily what
applies to myself, only general annotations that I find worthy to save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vestibular-disorder&#34;&gt;Vestibular Disorder&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few info on &lt;a href=&#34;https://vestibular.org/article/what-is-vestibular/&#34;&gt;what is a Vestibular
Disorder&lt;/a&gt; and, more
importantly, how to reduce its syntomps during
&lt;a href=&#34;https://vestibular.org/article/coping-support/living-with-a-vestibular-disorder/travel-strategies/&#34;&gt;travel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Philosophy and Religion</title>

      <guid>https://donearm.github.io/Scientia/philosophy_and_religion/index.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After history and fantasy, the third topic I like to read the most is
Philosophy and Religion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Natural Languages</title>
      <link>https://donearm.github.io/Scientia/natural_languages/index.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://donearm.github.io/Scientia/natural_languages/index.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A lot of sparse notes about all the natural languages that I know (or have
attemtped to). Most have very little value to offer but I publish them anyway
as here they are at least organized instead of collecting virtual dust in one
of my local directories.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Writing</title>

      <guid>https://donearm.github.io/Scientia/writing/index.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not a large section yet, as most of my actual writing is elsewhere. But here it
contains notes about how to write better, in terms of tools, style guides,
tricks, courses, and things to remember to help being a better writer.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://donearm.github.io/Scientia/various/index.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you may not surprisingly have imagined, here there are piece of my knowledge
that don&amp;rsquo;t fit under the other categories and aren&amp;rsquo;t that large to warrant
their own section.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
