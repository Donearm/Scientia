A few notes on the effects/causes of depression on/due to the brain.

Mostly coming from [The Upward Spiral book](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21413760-the-upward-spiral)

* Depressed subjects have less dopamine activity in the nucleus accumbens
* Dorsal striatum has strong ties with the nucleus accumbens
* Dopamine released in dorsal striatum doesn't increase feelings of pleasure
* Patterns in the dorsal striatum can't be erased, ever
* Serotonin is not unlimited
* Inhibiting an impulse uses serotonin
* The dopamine system helps modulating both slow-wave deep sleep and rem sleep
* Circadian rhythms influence the production of dopamine receptors, dopamine transponders and dopamine itself
* Depressed subjects have dysregulated oxytocin. Meaning, it is not always released when it should and it's sometimes released when should not. The brain responds to oxytocin isn't always on target
* Lower levels of oxytocin means more feelings of life not being worth living
* Child abuse can cause lower levels of oxytocin
* People with depression are more likely to have a gene for the oxytocin receptor that decreases confidence in social relationships and increases the need for approval
* Pleasure from social interactions correlates with oxytocin levels, in depressed people
* The oxytocin system supports the serotonin system
* Drugs drammatically lower oxytocin levels
* When sex hormones levels jump or drop, oxytocin neurons can stop working smoothly
* Cures/drugs that can influence the dopamine system: [Wellbutrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupropion), [Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation)
