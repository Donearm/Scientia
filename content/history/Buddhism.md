## Contacts between Buddhism and Christianity

One one of the major Ashoka's rock edicts, ([the 13th](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Rock_Edicts#Major_Rock_Edict_13)), it is stated how a few ellenistic kings were followers of the Dhamma. One of them is Ptolemy II and his sister Arsinoe II.

In the apocryphal Gospel of Thomas, at verse 90, Jesus says:
```
Come unto me, for my yoga is natural and my lordship is gentleâ€”and you shall find repose for yourselves.
```
thus literally naming Yoga in a text of very early Christianity. It is also stated by Dio Chrysostum and Clement (respectively 1st and 2nd century A.D.) that in Alexandria, Egypt, Indian scholars were a common sight (cit needed).
