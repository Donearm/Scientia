# Islamic Art

## Mosques

The very first mosques in the Arabic Peninsula were a simple, quadrat, 
construction with a small courtyard in front of it. There were still no 
_minbar_, _mirhab_ nor any idea of a minaret.

Those would be introduced by the Ommayads, with the early minarets being 
inspired by the late Roman defensive towers.
