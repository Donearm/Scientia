# Early Islamic Conquests

## Main notes

* Caliph Umar didn't want to invade Persia after occupying Iraq. He wished to retain the Mesopotamian area only but the ammassing of troops along the Zagros mountains and some Sassanid raids in southern Iraq forced him to act.

## Khalid ibn Walid

Originally an opposer to Muhammad, he was never a zealot in pushing Islam but more like a shrewd, bold and cunning military commander. Lots of his victories came from either stratagems to lure the enemies into more unfavorable terrain or by the quick movements of his cavalry.
