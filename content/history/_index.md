I am an history fan. One of the first book I read was the Cambridge University 
History of Ancient World. A long series of tomes about the history of the 
ancient civilizations. It was even before high school, so I kind of was reading 
ahead of the curriculum.

Over the years I have been reading nearly one third of all books as history 
books. I haven't been keeping many notes, confiding much on my memory. Old age 
is approaching so I recently started saving pieces of info that I find 
interesting here.
