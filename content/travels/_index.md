One of my favourite pastimes has always been traveling. And when I am not 
traveling, I plan the next trip.

Over time I collected a wealth of info about the best places to go, what to 
visit, where to eat, where to stay, and transportation tips over a large amount 
of places around the world. A lot I have deleted because terribly outdated. 
What is left are the timeless parts.
