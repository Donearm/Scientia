### Gili islands

Three small islands next to Lombok with beautiful sandy beaches and easily walkable.

Gili Trawangan is the westernmost and liveliest of the three. It is a good spot
to see sea turtles when the sea is calm.

Gili Memo, the middle one, is calm and geared towards romantic travellers. Not
the cheapest in terms of accomodations.

Gili Air, the easternmost one, is the laid-back one.

#### Transportation to Gili islands

From Bali, regular ferries leave from Sanur, Serangan and Padang Bai. The 
latter being the one with the most connections available. The whole trip is 
between 1,5hrs and 2,5hrs, depending on the type of ferry chosen. Some of the 
companies offering this trip are:

* Eka Jaya
* [Wahan Gili Ocean](https://wahanagiliocean.com)
* Scoot Fast Cruises
* Semaya One
* Ostina

There is also the possibility to move between the Gili islands by private or 
public ferry. The public one being the cheapest and can host around 30 persons.

## Getting around Bali

[Perama](https://www.peramatour.com/en/) offer modern buses that act as
shuttles between the main places in Bali.

Grab is an app alternative to Uber popular in Bali. Some drivers may take you
off the main streets for fear of the taxi mafia.
