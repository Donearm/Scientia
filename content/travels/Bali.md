## Excursions from Bali

* Lombok = By plane (25min) or ferry (4-5hr) from Padang Bai (east coast of Bali)
* Bromo-Tengger-Semeru Park = from Surabaya, bus or car (60-100km)
* Prambanan = flight to Yogyakarta and then bus (30min)
* Borobudur = flight to Yogyakarta and then bus (1hr)

### Nusa Penida and Nusa Lembongan

#### Transportation to Nusa Penida and Nusa Lembogan

Common ports to take a ferry or boat to both islands are Sanur and, especially, Padangbai. From the latter there's a slow ferry that can carry cars as well,
cheaper. Otherwise, the usual speed boats are available.

Some companies doing these routes are:

* [Maruti Group](https://marutigroupfastboat.com/)

### Gili islands

Three small islands next to Lombok with beautiful sandy beaches and easily walkable.

Gili Trawangan is the westernmost and liveliest of the three. It is a good spot
to see sea turtles when the sea is calm.

Gili Memo, the middle one, is calm and geared towards romantic travellers. Not
the cheapest in terms of accomodations.

Gili Air, the easternmost one, is the laid-back one.

Snorkeling on all the Gilis can be done from the beach, no particular need of 
booking a tour. Usually the west side of each island has the strongest currents 
while the east the weakest. On Gili Air, right on the east cost, turtles can be 
spotted.

#### Transportation to Gili islands

From Bali, regular ferries leave from Sanur, Serangan and Padang Bai. The 
latter being the one with the most connections available. The whole trip is 
between 1,5hrs and 2,5hrs, depending on the type of ferry chosen. Some of the 
companies offering this trip are:

* [Eka Jaya](https://ekajayafastboat.com/index.html)
* [Wahan Gili Ocean](https://wahanagiliocean.com)
* [Scoot Fast Cruises](http://scootcruise.com/) - possibly with a stop on Lembogan on the way to the Gilis
* Semaya One
* [Ostina](https://www.ostinafastboat.com/)

There is also the possibility to move between the Gili islands by private or 
public ferry. The public one being the cheapest and can host around 30 persons.

### Labuan Bajo and Komodo

A couple of small islands, remote, have great beaches and water:

* Le Pirate
* Kanawa

Both can be reached by renting a boat from Labuan Bajo port. There's nothing to 
do on these islands, being just a resort on an otherwise uninhabited island.

### Other islands

* Gili Layar is on the south-west of Lombok coast. It is quite remote and not 
  developed at all. There's a coral reef, plenty of beaches, and an atmosphere 
  of a quiet, tropical island.

## Getting around Bali

[Perama](https://www.peramatour.com/en/) offer modern buses that act as
shuttles between the main places in Bali.

Grab is an app alternative to Uber popular in Bali. Some drivers may take you
off the main streets for fear of the taxi mafia. Similarly for Gojack app.

A perhaps even cheaper way to book drivers and move around Bali is Klook app. 
Some reputed tour operators are on it as well.

From the Airport is usually not possible to use any app but only a pre-booked 
driver or a taxi. There should be a Grab office as of 2022 to book a ride 
though. Alternatively, getting out of the airport and through the Novotel puts 
you on a side street where Grab/Gojack drivers can pick you up.

Some reliable tour/driver companies:

### Prices

These are taxi prices and are an approximation. Updated as of summer 2022.

* Ubud to Sanur = 100-125k IDR
* Airport to main touristic areas of Bali = 200-300k IDR
