Sort of ideal itinerary for a 10-15 days trip.

# Not to miss

* Huahine
* Bora Bora
* Moorea
* Nuku Hiva (one of the Marquesas)

# Nice to go

* Rangiroa (an atoll)
* Fakarava (another atoll)
* Mauputi (a cheaper alternative to Bora Bora, very similar to it)
* Raiatea (rocky)
* Taha'a (next to Bora Bora, similar as it is an atoll around a rocky and mountainous island)
* Tikehau (another atoll, next to Rangiroa)
* Mataiva (an arid atoll, next to Tikehau)
