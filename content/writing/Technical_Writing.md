## Types of Technical Documentation

### Product documentation

This includes guides, training manuals and anything that shows an end user how 
to use a product. Installation and usage instructions, often with 
illustrations, FAQs and knowledge base articles fall into this category. User 
guides are a popular solution for both external users and internal employees to 
get started on the usage of a particular product.

#### API documentation

API documentation is geared towards developers to show them how to integrate 
and use an API service. This is often accomplished following the 
[OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) specifications.

#### SDK documentation

Similar to API documentation, SDK documentation show developers and tech-savy 
users how to use a SDK.

#### Release Notes

These are technical documents that are created and published along with the 
launch of a product or a new update of it. They detail the features, bugs, 
improvements, and fixes that have been the focus of the last version of a 
product (often a software). They can be all the way from purely technical to 
nearly marketing documents, with just links to the actual commits and bugs 
interested by the update.

#### Engineering resources

A category aside is for resources that are written for engineers and 
technicians. These includes, and are not limited to:

* BOMs (Bills of Materials) - a list of materials, components, and instructions 
  needed to construct, or manufacture, or repair a product or service
* Parts prints
* Schematics - both of circuits and products

Specific tools are [Arbortext](https://www.ptc.com/en/products/arbortext), 
[Teamcenter](https://plm.sw.siemens.com/en-US/teamcenter/).

### Process documentation / SOP

These are documents that show internal teams how to execute a task, use an 
internal tool, or follow a procedure. This is often accomplished with an 
internal wiki, and its structure is established by TWs.

Another name for process documentation is SOP (Standard Operating Procedure).

#### Project plans

More of a project manager task, project plans define goals and objectives of a 
project. They are created as a rather visual map of steps to take for a team in 
order to reach an objective or deliver a product.

#### Business standards

These are documents that set rules, guidelines, and benchmarks that a business 
should meet. They are often used during employees onboarding, as a teaching 
tool, and are written as a series of references that employees and the whole 
company adheres to. They may include company values and large objectives as 
well.

### Marketing and Sales documentation

Not everybody agrees this is proper techincal writing. But if you do, then this 
includes white papers, case studies, blogs, tutorials, and in-depth articles 
showing how a product or service can help somebody's business.

#### Market Requirements Documents (MRD)

These are documents that outline your potential customer base, their needs, and 
your competitors. They are part of a marketing plan. MRDs contain info about 
customer problems, their reasons, market opportunities, customer demographics, 
use cases, and competitors.

#### Request For Proposals (RFP)

This is a document that announces a project and solicits bids for it. In the 
end they are created to persuade customers and investors to buy or finance a 
product/service. Key points of this are the project overview, company 
background, project scope, and goal, often in a clear, visually-appealing, 
document.

### Scientific papers

Unrelated to most of the above are scientific papers. While they can fall into 
the "white paper" umbrella, proper scientific papers are focused on actual data 
coming from a research, ratehr than starting from the point of view of a 
problem or use case. These are thorough, accurate, highly technical documents.

when composing technical content. A list of remarkable style guides you can get 
inspiration from are:

  * [Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/).
  * [Google](https://developers.google.com/style) provides editorial guidelines for writing clear and consistent Google-related developer documentation.
  * [Di√°taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) - A systematic framework for technical documentation authoring.

* [Redhat's introduction to Modular Documentation](https://redhat-documentation.github.io/modular-docs)

## Tools

### Confluence

Often used for internal documentation, Confluence is an ok-ish tool for technical documentation. It has its quirks but lots of macros/plugins to customize the appearance of the content, and better format it.

#### Useful Macros/Plugins

* Colgroup Tag + Column = great at showing two variants of code next to each other, it embeds the content into multiple columns. No header is supported but it can easily be added manually and formatted as desired.
* Tabs Container + Tabs Page = alternatively to columns, when different version of similar content aren't necessarily needed to be shown together, tabs can be used. This macro support headers and will show like browser's tabs. Not much in the way of customization by default but CSS code is supported.
* Section + Column = a default option to have the page's layout split into columns.

#### Content reusing in Confluence

Multiple possibilities exist:

* Include macro = can include a whole page into another.
* Excerpt and Excerpt-Include macros = can include pieces of content into another page. The big limitation is that content can be included only once.
* Multiexcerpt macro = works as the Excerpt macro above but doesn't have the limitation of only including the content once.

An useful tip to organize content for reusing is to have a page per excerpt 
under the root of the wiki, not under any space to hid the page from searches. 
A special title, like a prepended underscore, can be used to differentiate 
these pages from the others. The Include macro can then be used to include 
content from this sort of mini-library of excerpts elsewhere.

All the excerpt macros can be set to `hidden` to hid them in the page where 
they are created but not from the page where they are included.

#### Tips

* Categories are best used to connect and group similar spaces together.
* Space and page layouts work with the Apache's [Velocity template engine](https://velocity.apache.org).

### Help & Manual

[Help & Manual](http://helpandmanual.com/) is an XML-based help authoring tool for writing help/manual pages.

### MadCap Flare

One of the main editor for technical writers, [MadCap Flare](http://www.madcapsoftware.com/) is only a part of a suite of tools for helping writers creating single-source documentation.

### Oxygen

A suite of tools to create documentation from XML files. The main one is the [XML Editor](https://www.oxygenxml.com).

### SDL Triton

A [web content manager](https://www.rws.com/content-management/tridion/), semantic AI search and all around solution for content management.

### RoboHelp

[Adobe RoboHelp](http://www.adobe.com/products/robohelp.html) is Adobe's effort for an help authoring tool.

### Scribus

As an open source tool, [Scribus](https://www.scribus.net/) is one of the most widespread. It is an XML-based software, which can import and export to multiple formats.

### Framemaker

Another Adobe tool, [Framemaker](http://www.adobe.com/products/framemaker) is specifically designed to handle a large amount of documents, structured or not.

#### Default DITA xml elements available in Framemaker

* Topic = an element that consists of a single, self-contained subject matter. 
* Concept = generally speaking, the Concept element can be considered as a 
  "specialized topic". It should be used when trying to answer all that is 
  necessary to do or achieve something, in a descriptive, usually, way.
* Task = as with the Concept, a task is a specialized topic that answers how, 
  procedurally, a task can be accomplished. It is more practical-oriented than 
  a Concept and usually doesn't include background info, as instead the Concept 
  does.
* Reference = another specialized topic, it differs from both the Concept and 
  Task as it neither provides background info or a step by step lists of 
  practical actions. It is meant to show general information about a topic that 
  can be useful, without explaining a specific task or topic, but being largely 
  just informative.

All the above elements are inserted into a new DITA xml file by selecting **New 
DITA File** in the menu and choosing the desired element from the submenu.

#### How to change background colour of a paragraph

1. Select the paragraph
2. Open the Paragraph Designer (Ctrl+M)
3. Go to the **advanced** tab
4. Change the colour, default is none, in the bottom right, under **Pgf. Box**

The colour will be by default applied to all the successive paragraphs. Set it 
back to none to cancel this.

##### Scalar

Not exactly a tool as the others, but it is an handy tool to get quickly 
started with creating an API documentation site with an already existing 
Swagger/OpenAPI file. Open source, [scalar](https://github.com/scalar/scalar) 
can be used with a skeleton html file, which will load your spec file, and use 
CDNs to load everything else, setting up an API documentation very quickly.

## Good practices and procedures

### Developing a Doc Plan

At the beginning of a project of any size, writing down a Doc Plan to help starting it out and following a fixed schedule. The plan will consists of:

* **Product Description**: a brief summary of the product
* **Audience**: the audience the documentation is aimed to
* **Deliverables**: name, format and descriptions of all documents, including media files if present, that will be created
* **Receivables**: what you as a writer need from others (accesses, product versions, availability of experts that can answer your questions, templates etc.)
* **Style**: what style guidelines will be followed
* **Tasks**: list of actions required to complete the project and who is responsible for each of them
* **Tools**: what tools will be used
* **Schedules**: one for each deliverable

Optionally, and especially when working for external clients, these points can be necessary as well:

* **Copyright**: who will own the copyright of the completed content
* **Cost**: a breakdown of the costs for each deliverable
* **Disclaimer**: add one that states that the ultimate responsibility for the accuracy of the content is of the client and/or developers
* **Terms**: payment schedule, cancellation policy and other legal terms

### Outline for good API documentation

* **Overview**: API name, audience, purpose, usage examples, requirements for 
  use, concepts, architecture, and architectural diagram
* **Quick Start**: the basics of setting up the API and use it for simple tasks
* **Getting Started**: a, possibly separated, section dedicated to setting up 
  the environment to use the API. This may include the sandbox or testing 
  environments, if offered
* **Tutorials**: a few step-by-step tutorials about how to achieve the most 
  common tasks with the API
* **Reference**: all methods, path parameters, query parameters, endpoints, 
  headers, sample requests, responses, sample responses, status, and error 
  codes for REST API. For a platform API, every class, method, function, 
  variable and so on

An useful AsciiDoc template is available on [arc42 Github](https://github.com/arc42/arc42-template/tree/master).

### Writing a good tutorial

A tutorial is a lesson. It is not "do A then B", mechanically, but should teach 
the reader how to do A and B by themselves. A tutorial must be:

* **Meaningful** - readers should get a sense of accomplishment
* **Successful** - readers should be able to complete the tutorial
* **Logical** - the path readers follow throough the tutorial needs to make sense
* **Usefully complete** - readers must encounter all the actions, concepts, and tools they need to become familiar with

Do not tell readers what they will learn. Tell them what **we** we'll do and 
encounter. Assume they will learn themselves, you are not going to teach them, 
only showing.

Make sure that every step of the tutorial can produce visible results. Make 
these results be as early as possible in the tutorial, to give readers a sense 
of accomplishment.

Prepare users for possible consequences of their actions. Inform them if a 
command will produce a long output, or if it will take a longer than possibly 
expected time to run. Also don't ignore lack of consequences, as in a message 
that should but did not appear, or a status that readers should reach but may 
not. Constantly inform readers of these possible situations.

Similarly, inform also readers of things that they should notice. A command 
prompt changes, or a new window opens etc.

Minimize explanations that are not strictly necessary to understand the 
tutorial. Do not explain choices made in detail, just inform the readers that 
we will be using program x or go with option y because of 
convenience/brevity/speed/whatever, and move on. There are other places where a 
detailed discussion of these choices may be done but they are not in the 
tutorial.

Similarly, ignore options and alternatives. Your tutorial should remain focused 
on the minimal steps necessary to reach the conclusion, not in all the possible 
ones that could lead to it. Take a path, and follow it, and only it.

Most of the above suggestions are extrapolated from 
[Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/tutorials/), and adapted by me for my own 
understanding.

### Tackling a new technical writing project

A series of questions to help starting out with a new project, from the very 
beginning when nothing is known about it.

* What is this product? Why would anyone want it?
    * Answer should come from asking SMEs and researching, not from a marketing standpoint
* How does the product fit in the ecosystem, if at all? Does it have any dependencies?
* Where can I acquire this product, and what versions exist?
* How do I install the product? What are the basic configuration options?
* What does a simple, start to finish, operation look like?
    * Any operation will do but it should take users from nothing to something, 
      convince readers that they learned something valuable
