## Tools

### Confluence

Often used for internal documentation, Confluence is an ok-ish tool for technical documentation. It has its quirks but lots of macros/plugins to customize the appearance of the content, and better format it.

#### Useful Macros/Plugins

* Colgroup Tag + Column = great at showing two variants of code next to each other, it embeds the content into multiple columns. No header is supported but it can easily be added manually and formatted as desired.
* Tabs Container + Tabs Page = alternatively to columns, when different version of similar content aren't necessarily needed to be shown together, tabs can be used. This macro support headers and will show like browser's tabs. Not much in the way of customization by default but CSS code is supported.

## Good practices and procedures

### Developing a Doc Plan

At the beginning of a project of any size, writing down a Doc Plan to help starting it out and following a fixed schedule. The plan will consists of:

* **Product Description**: a brief summary of the product
* **Audience**: the audience the documentation is aimed to
* **Deliverables**: name, format and descriptions of all documents, including media files if present, that will be created
* **Receivables**: what you as a writer need from others (accesses, product versions, availability of experts that can answer your questions, templates etc.)
* **Style**: what style guidelines will be followed
* **Tasks**: list of actions required to complete the project and who is responsible for each of them
* **Tools**: what tools will be used
* **Schedules**: one for each deliverable

Optionally, and especially when working for external clients, these points can be necessary as well:

* **Copyright**: who will own the copyright of the completed content
* **Cost**: a breakdown of the costs for each deliverable
* **Disclaimer**: add one that states that the ultimate responsibility for the accuracy of the content is of the client and/or developers
* **Terms**: payment schedule, cancellation policy and other legal terms
