# Good practices and procedures

### Develop a Doc Plan

At the beginning of a project of any size, writing down a Doc Plan to help starting it out and following a fixed schedule. The plan will consists of:

* **Product Description**: a brief summary of the product
* **Audience**: the audience the documentation is aimed to
* **Deliverables**: name, format and descriptions of all documents, including media files if present, that will be created
* **Receivables**: what you as a writer need from others (accesses, product versions, availability of experts that can answer your questions, templates etc.)
* **Style**: what style guidelines will be followed
* **Tasks**: list of actions required to complete the project and who is responsible for each of them
* **Tools**: what tools will be used
* **Schedules**: one for each deliverable

Optionally, and especially when working for external clients, these points can be necessary as well:

* **Copyright**: who will own the copyright of the completed content
* **Cost**: a breakdown of the costs for each deliverable
* **Disclaimer**: add one that states that the ultimate responsibility for the accuracy of the content is of the client and/or developers
* **Terms**: payment schedule, cancellation policy and other legal terms
