## Terminology

* Affinity Diagram
    * Also called "affinity chart" or "affinity mapping" or "K-J method" or 
      "thematic analysis". It is a visual mapping of ideas into their natural 
      relationships, often the output of a brainstorming session in a team.
* Card Sorting
    * In UX researching, card sorting is a technique in which participants sort 
      labels for content into larger categories. Thsi provides insight into how 
      participants group a product's content, how they associate different 
      pieces of content, helping to design the information architecture.
* Emphaty Map
    * A visual map used in UX researching to categorize what has been learned 
      about each research participant. It is split into 4 sections: "says", 
      "thinks", "does", "feels". Everything that has been learned about a 
      single participant is moved into one of these categories, which helps 
      researchers to understand what users want and need, and to communicate 
      these easily to other internal teams.
* Empty State
    * A moment in the user's experience with a product where there is nothing 
      to display or no further action is required. For example, it may be a 
      screen showing an empty folder after its creation, the screen after 
      completing all the elements in a todo list, a new account on a social 
      media where there are no connections yet, a page showing no results after 
      a search and so on.
* Error Prevention
    * In UX, the messages in an UI that help users to prevent committing a 
      mistake. Examples are many, but mostly undo buttons, red underlines under 
      a spelling mistake, messages alerting users that caps-lock is on, or that 
      a password should be longer. All types of confirmation messages before a 
      non-returning action (like booking an hotel room or making a purchase), 
      are part of error prevention messages.
* Fidelity
    * In UX, how closely should a prototype match the final product.
* Interaction Design (IxD)
    * The practice of designing interactive digital products, environments, 
      systems, and services.
* Microcopy
    * Small text snippets that guide users through apps and websites. These 
      includes buttons, pop-ups, alert messages, notifications, and all small 
      pieces of content that help users to navigate through a product. It is 
      the main UX writers' responsibility.
* Progressive Disclosure
    * An interaction design pattern that splits informations across multiple 
      screens to reduce users' cognitive load. Usually this means deferring 
      advanced or rarely-used features to later or secondary screens. Examples 
      are buttons to access advanced settings, print dialogues, "learn more" 
      and "related topics" links, advanced filters in a search field, and 
      similar elements.
* Task Analysis
    * An UX research method for mapping out how users complete a specific task 
      within your product.
