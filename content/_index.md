This is my "Scientia", latin for knowledge. It is my personal knowledge wiki, a collection of my knowledge that I reputed worth keeping over many years. Now it is shared online, free for everybody to consult.

It was born in the early 2000s and it included only subjects within the I.T.: tricks, commands worth remembering, procedures, and what not. 

The I.T. part of this wiki includes then solutions and info that are meant as quick answers to questions and doubts that may arise, tricks that you may be unaware of, and short references about the most disparate subjects within I.T.

The other sections instead were born more recently, when I thought that I was expanding my interests into multiple areas that were becoming important enough to warrant their own wiki. Thus, I merged these here, spanning from history to personal hobbies, to info about health to curiosities. For the time being they will be here; maybe one day they will have their own wiki or site.

If you need to know more about myself instead, head over my personal website at [gianlucafiore.it](https://www.gianlucafiore.it). Or my professional one as a writer, [fountainpencreator.com](https://www.fountainpencreator.com). Or explore my [IG feed](https://www.instagram.com/gianlucadfiore/) (mostly about my travels). Other social media I am not much present on.
