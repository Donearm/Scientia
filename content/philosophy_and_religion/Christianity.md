  did not consider the Gospels as canon but only as a sort of "memorable facts" 
  about the life of Christ

  then adopted by Greek philosophers and then caught by early Christian 
  theologians.

### Important figures

#### Origen of Alexandria

As an early Church Father (185-253 a.C.), he had later questionable ideas. For 
him, everything had a soul outside of the Trinity, even the sun and the stars. 
Souls of men came from elsewhere, already formed since the creation, as with 
Plato. And every soul will be eventually saved, even those of devils.

These theories were later rejected by the Church in the 6th century a.C.

#### Marcion of Sinope

[Marcion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcion_of_Sinope) was the founder of 
Marcionism. First to develop a New Testament canon, which included his own 
[Gospel of Marcion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gospel_of_Marcion). This text 
seems to be a revised gospel of Luke, with a lot of Judaism influenced 
removed.

Marcion preached that the God of Jesus was a new one, alien, separate from the 
one of the Old Testament.

Marcion was quickly declared heretic, and the Church was forced to create their 
own biblical canon in answer to Marcion's.

Some of his ideas resurfaced in Middle Age with the 
[Paulicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paulicianism), which also were 
considered heretics.

### Saint Augustine

While highly influential, he also held some later declared heretical positions. 
For instance, he held that angels may be both bad or good, while only devils 
were always bad. He also believed that we were all doomed after Adam's sin, and 
only God could grant salvation. This was unrelated to how one would act during 
life, and only God knew why some were saved and others damned. Even infants 
would automatically go to hell, unless God intervened. Only those who were 
baptized could be saved, adults or infants.

Regarding sex, he claimed that Adam and Eve before the original sin could have 
had sex without lust, only with will, but after that sin we all lost that 
capability, and fell to the sin of lust.

These theories were held as orthodox for centuries, until the 
Counter-Reformation or later, when were abandoned by the Catholic Church.

## Non-theological facts

### Antisemitism

* Gregory of Nyssa was one of the primary theologians of the early Church. He 
  famously cursed the Jews in a sort of prayer, in mid 4th century a.C.
* Elvira, in south of Spain, in 306 a.C. prohibited any relationship between 
  its citizens and Jews
* [Cyril of Alexandria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_of_Alexandria), 
  venerated as Saint Cyril, was the patriarch of Alexandria in the early fifth 
  century who supported pogroms and later expulsed Jews from the city. He had 
  also a hand in the murder of the philosopher Hypatia, albeit the historians 
  are still debating how important was his role.

### Other facts

* Ignatius of Antioch first used the greek word _katholikos_ to describe the 
  Church (2nd century a.C.). He also opposed the term to "heretic", for the 
  first time.
  * He is also responsible for the idea of a monarchic conception of the 
	bishops, where each christian community should be ruled by a bishop.
* At the beginning of the 3rd century a.C. the bishop of Rome Hippolitus 
  denounced at least 32 christian sects.
* Porphyry was the author of a series of 15 books [Against the 
  Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_the_Christians). No copy of 
  any remain today, only citations from other writers. He was a neoplatonic 
  thinker.
* The principle of not reciprocating evil present in the Sermon of the Mount, 
  was already stated by Socrates as:
  `We ought not to retaliate evile for evil to any one, whatever evil we may 
  have suffered from him`
* The [Therapeautae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutae) was a Christian 
  sect in Alexandria from 1st century a.C. Their practices were similar to 
  Theravada Buddhism and their name may have been an adaption to Greek of the 
  pali word Theravada.
* Pope Liberius in 354 a.C. first associated the winter solstice and roman 
  celebration of Brumalia with the date of birth of Jesus
* The Cathari were dualists, believing in a God and a Demiurge. Like the 
  Gnostics, they believed the Demiurge to be the God of the Old Testament while 
  the true, and only good one, God was of the New.
* The Bogomiles were a fusion of Manichaeans and Paulicians. They rejected 
  infant baptism, purgatory, the invocation of saints, and the whole Trinity.
