## Eliminative materialism/Eliminativism

In general, eliminativism refers to the class of views in sciences that deny the existence of some entities. In the [philosophy of mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy_of_mind) realm, Eliminativism means the denial of existence of various states of the mind, such as belief or desire. It postulates how no scientifical basis for the existence of these states will ever be found.

Other versions include also pain or visual perceptions in this denial.

This current of thought originates in the 1960-1970s.

Eliminativism is in direct contrast with common physicology, asserting how it has roughly failed and most of it will be corrected/negated by neuroscience and developments of artificial intelligence. Original eliminativists considered both true that some mental states didn't exist and that they could be explained in terms of lower-level neurophysiological states. Modern ones tend to think more on the complete denial of many mental states, rather that using neuroscience as an explanation.
