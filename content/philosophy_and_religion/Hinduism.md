## Veda

[Prajapati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prajapati) is the progenitor God of the Rigveda. He is later to be equated with Brahma and, especially, the concept of the Brahman. He is considered the creator of the world, being born of the cosmic golden egg (or being the actual egg), that existed among the primeval waters. It has been proposed a comparison between Prajapati and the cult of Orpheus as a creator God in ancient and hellenistic Greece.

### Saptarshi

Mytical seers, 7 in total, from the Rigveda, that cyclically are incarnated to teach the Vedas.

## Philosophical schools within Hinduism

* [Ajivika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80j%C4%ABvika) - contemporary to the Buddha's lifetime, it is in strike contrast with his teachings, being fatalist and deterministic. Everything was believed governed by fate, no free will existed, no superior God existed.
+ [Cārvāka](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C4%81rv%C4%81ka) - contemporary school to Buddha's lifetime, which has arguably influenced his teachings. Materialistic, skeptic, atheist.
+ [Samkhya](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samkhya) - one of the most ancient schools, already rejecting the concept of an unitary God (Ishvara).
