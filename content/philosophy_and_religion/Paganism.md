## Greek Paganism

Certain deities, in particular Zeus and Poseidon, were never depicted by images 
during the Archaic period (cit. A History of Pagan Europe, ch 2, pg 85)

## Roman Paganism

Varro tells us that the early Romans worshipped their deities without images.
The basic Roman belief seems to have been in numen or supernatural power rather 
than in personified spirits (cit. A History of Pagan Europe, ch 3, pg 52)

The god Mithras, as acceptd in Roman religion, was changed from the original 
Persian role of a mediator between the god of light and order, Ahura-Mazda, and 
the one of darkness and chaos, Ahriman.

## Nordic Paganism

The viking leader Ragnar Lodbrok is today celebrated as a martyr by 
contemporary followers of Asatru (cit. A History of Pagan Europe ch 7, pg 125)
