# Products

## AMI

Amazon Machine Images. Images to choose from to launch an instance.

## AWS CLI

The command-line interface to AWS services.

### Useful Commands

* `aws configure` = initial command to run in order to configure access ID, secret access key, role name and zone to access AWS resources from the CLI. It stores the configuration under `~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config`

## CloudFormation

## EFS

## ElasticIPs

ElasticIPs are public IP addresses associated with a VPC. The difference with normal public IP addresses is if the instance associated with an ElasticIP goes down, the IP is maintained and associated to the new instance brought up to cover the failed one. This way no interruption of connection is caused by changing the IP address.
