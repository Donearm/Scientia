The largest section under Operating Systems by far. I have been using Linux 
since around 2002 and as my main OS since 2004-2005.

Most I know about Linux I learned using Slackware, then Gentoo, then Archlinux. 
But I used to distro-hop a lot in the early years of my Linux learning and have 
probably tested between 15 and 20 different distro (tested as in installed, not 
just ran from a live usb pendrive).
