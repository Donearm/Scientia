## Configure Wireless and Wired connections

Create a `wpa_supplicant.conf` file in /boot, which will be later copied on the root partition at `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`, with these contents:

```cfg
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=<Insert 2 letter ISO 3166-1 country code here>

network={
	ssid="<Name of your wireless LAN>"
	psk="<Password for your wireless LAN>"
}
```

More info [here](Ã®200~https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/headless.md).

For a wired connection, it should connect automatically. Just make sure that the router the RaspberryPi is attached to is accepting connections from new devices and not rejecting them by default.
