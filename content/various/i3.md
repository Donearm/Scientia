### How to save layout and reload at boot

First, save the current layout of any workspace with:

```bash
i3-save-tree --workspace 1 > ~/.config/i3/i3-workspace-1.json
```

Where `1` refers to the workspace number. Make sure that all the clients you 
want to be run on that workspace are open and visible before running the 
command.

After that, the workspace json file will be created but all the classes and 
proprieties of the clients caught will be commented. Uncomment the minimum you 
need to recognize all the clients before using the file.

To enable then the workspace file at startup, add this to your i3 
configuration:

```bash
exec --no-startup-id "i3-msg 'workspace 1; append_layout ~/.config/i3/i3-workspace-1.json'"
```

Have this line _before_ the one that launches the actual clients named in the 
workspace file and you are all set for next i3 startup.
