## Google Ads

Google Search Network = search + Google Play + Google Shopping + Google Maps + search partners

Google Display Ads Network = as above + partner sites with Adsense

### Match types

* **Broad Match** = the default, matches misspellings, synonyms and related searches
* **Broad Match Modifier** = a `+` in front of a keyword. Matches only keywords and close varations of them
* **Phrase Match** = quotation marks (`"`) around a phrase. Matches only the exact phrase or close variations of it
* **Exact Match** = with brackets (`[]`) around the keywords. Matches only searches with the same __meaning__, which may mean also misspellings and different words
* **Negative Keywords** = with a minus `-` sign before a keyword. Matches only searches without such a keyword
* **Dynamic Search Ads** = if enabled, generates ads matching the website content to catch queries not covered by the keywords

Responsive Search Ads are a combination of headline, url and description that the system will match on its own to a keyword. Recommended to have at least 1 per ad group. Up to 15 headlines and 4 descriptions per ad.

### Bid Strategies

* **Target Impression Share** = maximize auctions to meet a specific threshold for a specific location on the search page
* **Maximize Clicks** = maximize potential clicks
* **Maximize Conversions** = drive as much conversion volume as possible
* **Target Cost Per Acquisition (tCPA)** = increase conversions while reaching your average cost-per-acquisition goal
* **Enhanced Cost Per Click (eCPC)** = adjust bid up and down based on each click's likelihood of resulting in a conversion
* **Target Return On Ad Spend (Target ROAS)** = get as much conversion value as possible while mantaining the target return on ad spend that you set

### Audience Solutions

A set of strategies and products to create lists to layer onto your ad groups.

* **Variable Bidding** = automatically increase or decrease bids on certain audiences
* **Keyword Expansion** = target generic keywords and only show ads to certain audiences
* **Creative Customization** = target specific audiences with bespoke text ads

## Create a Marketing Plan

* Start with an empty presentation
* Fill only headings at the beginning
* As you collect data, fill the presentation

### 1. Collect Data

Most important data to gather:

* Market size
* Market fluctuation
* Economic and regulatory influences
* Market shares of your client and main competitors'
* Market share changes and why
* Data about competitors, especially:
	* Products
	* Services
	* Price points
	* Promotions on web and social media
	* Value propositions
	* Customer loyalty

### 2. Select the mission statement

Define company's business and relative objectives. Establish a vision statement (the desired future position of the company). Both the mission and vision statements may already exist. If so, ask about them and review them.

### 3. Write a market analysis

Points to consider:

* Total Addressable Market (TAM). Meaning the total sales of all companies in the industry + potential new customers.

Total Industry Sales / TAM = Market Penetration OR % of total market reached

Company Total Industry Sales / Total Market Sales = Revenue Market Share

Write a SWOT analysis:

* Strenghts of the client
* Weaknesses of the client
* Opportunities of the client (like favorable situations)
* Threats for the client (unfavorable situations)

### 4. Describe a current customer's persona

### 5. Write a customer buying process map

* Describe how a customer gets awareness of the products/services
* How customers search and evaluate alternatives
* Purchase and post purchase behaviour
* Write what benefits a typical customers may be looking for

### 6. Write a product/service analysis

* For each product or service write the features and relative benefits
* Compare with client's competitors and identify what matches, the gaps and the opportunities

### 7. Collect all the data thus gathered in an overall strategy
