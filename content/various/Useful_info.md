A miscellaneous collection of links that are not immediately useful but may be, 
eventually. Nothing that would match the other pages only.

## Driving license

Driving license (patente B) to obtain in Italy:

* First theory exam, of 40 questions. This can be done online.
* Then, if passed, a "foglio rosa" is granted which gives the owner the right 
  to take the practical exam
* Within 6 months from the theory exam, the practical one can be attempted. Two 
  tries.

Usually some practice is assumed before the practical exam, and driving schools 
offer it along with the actual exam. It is optional too, practice can be done 
on your own.
