As a self-taught programmer, I didn't follow a structured learning system but 
learned by testing, practicing, and breaking things. After a few years of 
professional work, I found the desire to know more about the theory behind what 
I was doing and started following a few courses and reading books about CS 
Theory.

The results of what I learned are here.
