## Notes

As a great fan of the Malazan Book of the Fallen fantasy series, I like to collect small notes and facts during my rereads. Here they are, as a curiosity or starting point of further researching.

The notes are separated by the book they are in, and ordered by page count.

### Gardens of the Moon

* `pg 352-359`: K'rul helps a Rhivi woman and P'ran Chole to give birth to Silverfox in a dream of Kruppe.
* `pg 386`: Hood, Dessembrae, and all the Tiste Andii were present at the first Chaining.
* `pg 577`: 800 years earlier, Rake last met with Icarium, with Mappo and Osric also present. Icarium and Osric had an altercation.
* `pg 596`: Raest considers the Soletaken as aliens.

### Deadhouse Gates

* `pg 84`: Seven Cities were named so after 7 ascendants that founded them.
* `pg 92`: The Emperor fought both Treach and Ryllandaras outside Li Heng, with Fiddler being present.
* `pg 327`: Heboric cures Gesler, but also passes him something else, power of some sort.
* `pg 428`: Sormo claims that Jaghut ice magic destroyed the Forkrul Assail civilizations and K'Chain Che'Malle mechanisms and edifices.
* `pg 652`: Legends tell how Icarium emerged from Raraku.
* `pg 648`: 94000 years before, Icarium destroyed a city in Raraku, with its 7 thrones, but spared a large mechanism he developed.
* `pg 738`: Cotillion ordered the Talons to kill all Nameless Ones they could find.
* `pg 813`: Dassem Ultor's daughter was left in Tremorlor "after Hood was done playing with her" by his father.

### Memories of Ice

* `pg 189`: Once Anomander Rake killed a score of Seguleh, before being forced to retreat. He is considered the 7th Seguleh.
* `pg 193`: There has been a mage called Nightchill for hundred years in the Malazan army.
* `pg 349`: Gothos has a brother, Gethal, who was Herald of house Death, before deciding to join the Crippled God.
* `pg 355-362`: Quick Ben absorbs the 11 souls of other mages that were his companions while escaping the Bridgeburners in Raraku. The Bridgeburners were born that day when Quick Ben decided to join Whiskeyjack's company after finally being caught.
* `pg 406`: Toc the Younger is son of Toc the Elder and Cartheron Crust's sister.
* `pg 442-443`: The Barghast fought the Tiste Edur at sea, east of the Genabackis continent. The Tiste were forced to retreat south-east, perhaps to Assail.
* `pg 443`: The Moranth are kin with the Barghast but despised by them. They made peace with the Tiste Edur, learnt their arts, and separated from their Barghast cousins.
* `pg 748`: Anomander Rake explains how when Heboric was punished, Fener denied him and his hands. Then when Heboric touched the jade statue on the Otataral island, which contained the souls of the followers of the Crippled God, its chaotic magic fought Fener's. It eventually pushed the God out of his realm, into the mortal one
* `pg 799`: Kellanved ordered the Logros clan to look for all other T'lan Imass clans. The quest was unsuccessful
* `pg 967`: Kurald Emurlahn is a shattered warren, inaccessible to mortals. The part that Shadowthrone rules is only a fragment, a sort of gatehouse to the rest
* `pg 969`: The real Throne of Shadow is accessible from Drift Avalii. It is sought after by the Tiste Edur, sworn to destroy Mother Dark, and defended by a group of Tiste Andii
* `pg 972`: Draconus created Dragnipur to preserve the Throne of Darkness from the assailing powers of Chaos. The more, and more powerful, souls that are sent into it, the faster the internal carriage moves away from Chaos. Eventually Draconus claims that the sword must be shattered to prevent Chaos from ever reaching the Throne

### House of Chains

* `pg 295`: The ship of the Emperor apparently sunk in Malaz City harbour the night of the "assassination"
* `pg 296-297`: Admiral Nok recounts how the Empire started:
    * Kellanved and Dancer were the first partners. They teamed up to bring down Mock, a pirate ruler of Malaz island
    * Nok Ameron and Hawl, Nok's wife, joined them.
    * They all had access to the Deadhouse on the island, using it as a base and benefitting from its powers. They were granted longevity, immunity to most diseases and "other things".
    * Next to be recruited were the Napan brothers Cartheron and Urko Crust, Surly, Dassem Ultor.
    * Toc the Elder, Tayschreen, at the time a renegade high septarch of the D'rek cult, and Dujek were the last to be recruited into the "family", as Nok calls it.
    * Surly was of the Napan royal line.
    * When Surly became Laseen and "killed" Kellanved and Dancer, the first to disappear and abandon her were the Napan of the family, the Crust brothers and Ameron (an half-Napan to be correct).
* `pg 480-481`: Kimloc the Spiritwalker associated a Tanno song with the Bridgeburners. The song needs to eventually be sanctioned, and for that are both necessary a Bridgeburner and the place where they were born, thus Raraku.
* `pg 481-482`: The giants of jade have created otatarale when they fell from another realm, due to the powerful magic necessary to pull them (or rather the Crippled God). So far 3 giants have been discovered.
* `pg 587-592`: in a drugged dream Heboric has a vision of the jade giants. He sees how they follow the Crippled God through a large flaming sash in the sky, and how they contain thousands of its followers.
* `pg 674`: Onrack painted Kilava in a cave, somehow trapping her and rendering her thus immortal, before the Tellan ritual. He was for this condemned to die but escaped punishment thanks to the menace of four Jaghut Tyrants allying 
  together. Kilava in turn would tun on her clan, killing them all but for Onon T'oolan, her brother, that resisted her.
* `pg 778-779`: Logros T'lan Imass moved the First Throne away from the Nameless Ones because they feared that if one of them were to sit on it, he would order all T'lan Imass to permanently move inside the Azath Houses and 
  in all practice disappear from the world.
* `pg 779`: Kellanved sought for and in the end discovered the First Throne. He claimed it but commanded the T'lan Imass only sparingly.
* `pg 817-818`: Osric tells his son L'oric how the Deragoth domesticated some of the Eres, the Imass and humans progenitors. They fought against the K'Chain Che'Malle, destroying their skykeeps. Later, after the Eres extinction, the Deragoth allied with the First Empire of Dessimbelackis.

### Midnight Tides

* `pg 25-26`: Mael asked Gothos to preserve the field of battle between the Tiste, Andii and Edur, and the K'Chain Che'Malle. It caused the Gothos Ice Fields in north Lether and presumably blocked the development of magic on the continent to our days.
* `pg 206`: in a vision Udinaas sees a Forkrul Assail inside the Letheras Azath House, next to the corpses of a murdered Jaghut family.
