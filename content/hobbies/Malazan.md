As a great fan of the Malazan Book of the Fallen fantasy series, I like to collect small notes and facts during my rereads. Here they are, as a curiosity or starting point of further researching.

The notes are separated by the book they are in, and ordered by page count.

* `pg 352-359`: K'rul helps a Rhivi woman and P'ran Chole to give birth to Silverfox in a dream of Kruppe.
* `pg 386`: Hood, Dessembrae, and all the Tiste Andii were present at the first Chaining.
* `pg 577`: 800 years earlier, Rake last met with Icarium, with Mappo and Osric also present. Icarium and Osric had an altercation.
* `pg 596`: Raest considers the Soletaken as aliens.
