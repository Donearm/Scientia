## Noticeable lyrics

I rarely pay attention to lyrics. I am more focused on the music, the vibe, the 
technical skills of the instrumentalists rather than the words (and the singing 
as well). Occasionally a song catches my attention in an unusual way and then I 
go to read the lyrics.

More often than not, the lyrics aren't that great but very, very rarely, they 
are. I will save here links to lyrics that  are worth reading (and the song 
isn't bad either).
