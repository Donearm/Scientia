I rarely drink wine. I grew up in Italy and wine was largely accessible and 
common on everyday's table, but I did not indulge in it much. My palate is yet 
unable to get much of the differences of wine varieties and certainly I cannot 
distinguish an expensive bottle from a supermarket one. I aim to improve, 
though.
